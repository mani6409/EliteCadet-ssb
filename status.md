# status.md — SSB Academy Web Platform State Snapshot

**Type:** Current project state. Reporting only — never a source of requirements.
**Question this file answers:** *If I open this project today, what is the exact state?*
**Last updated:** 2026-10-07 (T080 admin access foundation for the content-admin panels, on
`feat/admin-access-foundation`; see §13a)
**Last updated:** 2026-09-24 (test suite split into unit / integration / e2e layers, new tests
added, CI workflow added on `chore/test-structure-audit`; see §13a)
**Last updated:** 2026-09-23 (Day 2 Resources visual/text refinement, round 3; includes the latest `origin/main` changes merged into this branch)

## 0. Evidence Basis (read this first)

T001 (repository inspection) has run. The repository now exists: a Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind
scaffold generated with `create-next-app`, installed, built and committed to git. Statements below
about the scaffold are `VERIFIED` by direct inspection (`npm install`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`
all run clean). Everything under Phase 1 onward remains `UNVERIFIED` — no feature code has been
written yet.

Status vocabulary used throughout: `VERIFIED` · `UNVERIFIED` · `PARTIAL` · `BROKEN` · `BLOCKED` ·
`DEFERRED`.

## 1. Current State

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stage | Foundation (T001–T005) + public shell/landing (T010/T011) + full Student (T020, T030–T038 except T034/T035, **+ T039 5-Day SSB Practice Journey**) + full Mentor (T021, T040–T045) + full Academy (T022, T050–T055) experiences + **real Supabase authentication and role-based access (T013/T014)** complete |
| Current focus | Web platform MVP — auth is real now, Practice now covers the full 5-day journey. Only AI feedback (T034/T035) and Phase 6 audits remain |
| Documentation | `VERIFIED` — all four files rewritten and reconciled 2026-09-16; re-sequenced 2026-09-18; `specs.md` un-deferred the 5-Day journey 2026-09-20 |
| Codebase | `VERIFIED` — Next.js scaffold + Glass Capsule tokens + capsule primitives + shadcn/ui base UI system + public site + full Student (incl. the 5-Day Practice Journey), Mentor and Academy experiences + Supabase auth, committed to git (`.env.local` holds real project credentials, gitignored, not committed) |
| Build | `VERIFIED` — `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit` all succeed (Next.js 16.3.5, Turbopack). Middleware redirect behavior smoke-tested with curl (unauthenticated → `/login`, confirmed for `/student`, `/mentor`, `/academy`, `/onboarding`). T039's full journey walkthrough smoke-tested end-to-end via Playwright against a production build (see §13a, 2026-09-20) |
| Tests | `PARTIAL` — unit / integration / e2e layers, all passing locally (84 Vitest + 9 Playwright cases; see `tests/TEST_CASES.md`). CI workflow added but not yet run on GitHub — needs push + Supabase secrets (T066). Real signup/login has not been click-tested in a browser by a human this session; T039's full journey walkthrough was separately smoke-tested end-to-end via Playwright against a production build (see §13a, 2026-09-20) — neither substitutes for the user's own click-through |
| Next action | Resolve B3 (AI provider) to unblock T034/T035 — the only remaining MVP feature gap. Then finish Phase 6 quality/security audits (T060–T066 — T066's test suite is in progress: Vitest + Playwright installed and passing, not yet wired into CI), which must also close the mock-data gap under T014 (see Technical Debt) |

Core loop being built:

Onboard → Practice → AI Feedback → Improve → Practice Again
```

## 2. Documentation State — `VERIFIED`

| File | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Rewritten | Glass Capsule design system added as §7 (mandatory); regression-prevention rules added; `CLAUDE.md` retired |
| `specs.md` | Rewritten | Scope contradictions resolved; acceptance criteria added per feature; non-SSB (media player / rooms) requirements excluded |
| `task.md` | Rewritten | Every task now carries priority, dependencies, requirements, acceptance criteria and tests |
| `status.md` | Rewritten | This file; all implementation claims marked `UNVERIFIED` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **Retired** | No longer authoritative. Reduce to a pointer to `AGENTS.md`, or delete |

---

## 3. Architecture State

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Project structure | `VERIFIED` — App Router scaffold (`app/`, `public/`), no `src/` dir, matches `AGENTS.md` §5 target (subdirectories not yet created) |
| Installed versions | `VERIFIED` — Next.js 16.3.5, React 19.2.8, TypeScript 5.9.3, Tailwind CSS 4.3.3, ESLint 9.x, eslint-config-next 16.3.5 |
| Routing | `VERIFIED` — App Router default (`/`, `/_not-found`); no product routes yet |
| Design tokens | `VERIFIED` — `app/globals.css`: navy scale, bg/text, semantic status colors, glass opacity/blur/border, two shadow levels, capsule radii, motion duration/easing + reduced-motion override; spacing intentionally reuses Tailwind's default scale (no second system) |
| Capsule primitive components | `VERIFIED` — `components/ui/capsule.tsx`: `CapsulePrimary`/`CapsuleSecondary`/`CapsuleSmall`, all 8 states, keyboard focus, responsive at 320/768px (see Decisions Register for a cascade-layer bug found and fixed) |
| Base UI system | `VERIFIED` — shadcn/ui (Radix + Nova preset) installed: button, input, select, dialog, tabs, badge, table, alert, label, textarea, separator, skeleton; all remapped from shadcn's default neutral palette onto the navy design tokens (see Decisions Register). Custom `EmptyState`/`ErrorState`/`LoadingState` in `components/ui/` cover `AGENTS.md` §12. Typography scale uses Tailwind's default `text-*` scale (no second system, same precedent as spacing) |
| API client layer | `VERIFIED` — `lib/api/*` (read paths) + `lib/actions/*` (Server Action mutations) per domain; see §4/§5 below |
| Authentication | `VERIFIED` — real Supabase Auth: `lib/api/auth.ts` (signUp/logIn/password reset), `lib/auth/actions.ts` (logout), `lib/auth/session.ts` (server-side current-user helper). No email confirmation required (dashboard setting, by decision) |
| Authorization / academy isolation | `PARTIAL` — role-based route access is `VERIFIED` (middleware + RLS on `profiles`/`academies`); per-academy data isolation for students/mentees/batches is `UNVERIFIED` — that data is still mock, not real Postgres (Technical Debt) |
| AI feedback integration | `UNVERIFIED` + `BLOCKED` (provider undecided, B3) |
| Backend / database | `PARTIAL` — Supabase Postgres is live for auth (`profiles`, `academies` — migration `supabase/migrations/0001_init_auth.sql`, must be run in the Supabase SQL Editor); every other domain (students, batches, mentees, evaluations, sessions, resources, practice) is still mock/in-memory |
| Storage | `UNVERIFIED` + `BLOCKED` |
| Testing infrastructure | `PARTIAL` — Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/component) and Playwright (e2e) installed and passing (`npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`); not yet wired into CI. See `tests/TEST_CASES.md` |
| Lint | `VERIFIED` — `npm run lint` passes clean |
| Build | `VERIFIED` — `npm run build` (Turbopack) succeeds |
| Git | `VERIFIED` — repository initialized, ongoing commits |
| Environment variables | `VERIFIED` — `.env.local` (gitignored): `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (service role used only server-side, for the real mentor-invite Server Action) |

**Note:** the rows above this line (project structure, routing, design tokens, etc.) reflect the
2026-09-16 T001–T005 snapshot and have not been re-audited since — `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` and
`types/` have grown substantially (see §4/§5 and the task.md roadmap for what actually exists now). A
full re-audit is due before Phase 6.

Intended architecture (target, not observed):

```text
Browser → Next.js App → Backend API → PostgreSQL / AI Provider / Storage
```

## 4. UI State

> **2026-09-19 — design system replaced.** Everything below this notice describing "Glass Capsule"
> (navy brand colour, `CapsulePrimary`/`Secondary`/`Small`) is **superseded** and kept only as a
> historical record of the T003–T005 build. The live design system is now **Apple-Inspired Glass UI
> v3** (`AGENTS.md` §7, full spec in `UI design.md`) — see the Decisions Register entry below for
> rationale and the summary immediately following this notice for current state.

### 4.0 Current design system — Apple-Inspired Glass UI v3 — `VERIFIED`

- **Tokens** (`app/globals.css`): ink/ink-secondary/surface-base/hairline, single brand-accent
  (indigo) + brand-accent-2, three status colours, three glass material tiers (thin/regular/thick),
  five-step radius scale, shadow-soft/elevated/glow-accent, motion duration/easing. `--brand-accent`
  deliberately not named bare `--accent`, to avoid colliding with shadcn's own `--accent` semantic
  slot (used internally for hover-highlight backgrounds).
- **Shell** (`components/layout/`): `AppShell` composes `Sidebar` (glass-thick, pill nav items, active
  = accent gradient + glow), `TopHeader` (glass-thick, search capsule + notifications + avatar menu),
  `MobileTabBar` (floating glass-thick bottom bar, <900px). One shell, parameterized by role — used
  identically by `app/student/layout.tsx`, `app/mentor/layout.tsx`, `app/academy/layout.tsx`.
- **Shared content patterns** (`components/ui/`): `StatCard`, `PageHeader`, `ListPanel`/`ListRow`,
  `EmptyState` (redesigned), `ErrorState`/`LoadingState` (redesigned), `StatusTag` (colour + text/dot,
  never colour-only), `FilterChip`, `DetailHeader`, `nav-icons.tsx` (icon registry, replaces the old
  `capsuleIcons`).
- **Retired:** `components/ui/capsule.tsx` and the per-role `*-header.tsx`/`*-nav.tsx` components
  (`components/{student,mentor,academy}/`) — deleted, replaced by the shared shell above.
- **Ambient background:** one persistent `.ambient-wash` div in `app/layout.tsx` (root layout, never
  remounted per route), indigo→cyan radial wash, `prefers-reduced-motion` freezes it via the existing
  global reduced-motion rule.
- **Migration scope:** every page under `app/`, every component under `components/{student,mentor,
  academy,auth,shared,practice}/`, and the public site were swept for the old token names
  (`glass-surface`, `text-text-primary/muted`, `brand-navy*`, `bg-bg-base/ambient`) and either
  mechanically renamed or structurally rewritten (Capsule usages) onto the new system. Verified via
  `npm run build` + `npm run lint` + `npx tsc --noEmit` (all clean) and rendered-HTML checks for `/`,
  `/login`, `/signup`.
- **Known remaining polish (not blocking):** dropdown menus (profile menu, select dropdowns) still use
  shadcn's default solid `bg-popover` chrome rather than being explicitly restyled as `glass-thick`;
  visually acceptable but not yet swept for full §7.13 screen-acceptance-test compliance page by page.
  Track under a future T070-equivalent consistency pass.

### 4.1 Historical (superseded 2026-09-19) — original Glass Capsule build record

- **Design system:** Glass Capsule (`AGENTS.md` §7) — `VERIFIED` implemented (tokens T003, primitives
  T004, base UI T005).
- **Design tokens:** `VERIFIED` — see §3 Architecture State.
- **Capsule primitives:** `VERIFIED` — see §3 Architecture State; extended with `dashboard`/`resources`/
  `profile` icon registry entries (`components/ui/capsule.tsx`) for the student nav.
- **Public site:** `VERIFIED` — `SiteHeader`/`SiteFooter` (`components/layout/`), landing page
  (`app/(public)/page.tsx`) covering role benefits and the core loop. `/login`, `/signup`,
  `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` are real (T013), no longer placeholders. Verified visually at
  ~390px and desktop widths (pre-auth version; not re-screenshotted after the auth forms replaced the
  placeholders — Chrome extension not connected this session).
- **Student shell (T020):** `VERIFIED` — `app/student/layout.tsx` + `StudentHeader`/`StudentNav`
  (`components/student/`). Nav: Dashboard/Practice/Progress/Resources/Profile as `CapsuleSmall`,
  vertical rail on `md+`, horizontal-scroll row on mobile. Header has a notifications popover (empty
  state — no fake notifications) and a profile dropdown menu with a real logout item
  (`components/ui/popover.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`). **Now has a real server-side auth guard** —
  `middleware.ts` (T014) — see Decisions Register, 2026-09-19.
- **Student onboarding (T030):** `VERIFIED` — `app/onboarding/page.tsx` +
  `components/student/onboarding-form.tsx`. Single-page form (name, target exam, preparation stage,
  optional academy, goals), field validation, draft persisted to `localStorage` so a refresh mid-flow
  doesn't lose input, and a client-side "already completed" flag so it can't be trivially repeated.
  This flag is per-browser only until real auth exists (documented, not hidden).
- **Student dashboard (T031):** `VERIFIED` — `app/student/page.tsx`. Zero-activity and populated
  states both implemented and both rendered-checked (`/student` vs `/student?preview=active` — the
  query param is a dev-only preview switch, documented in code, not user-facing chrome). Sections:
  header greeting, overall readiness, activity metrics, Today's Mission (primary capsule), upcoming
  session, My Progress (compact trend), recent activity, recommendations. Achievements/Leaderboard
  correctly absent. `/student/practice`, `/student/progress`, `/student/resources`, `/student/profile`
  are explicit "coming soon" stubs (same pattern as the earlier `/login`/`/signup` placeholders), not
  silently broken links.
- **Verification method:** `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit` all pass; rendered HTML
  fetched via `curl` for `/student`, `/student?preview=active`, `/onboarding` and all four stub routes
  confirmed expected content. Not yet verified in an actual browser (Claude in Chrome extension was
  not connected this session) — user should open `http://localhost:3000/student` and
  `/onboarding` to confirm visually.
- **Known migration risk:** earlier guidance specified rounded cards and a purple accent — resolved;
  no such UI exists in the repository.

## 5. Feature State

Nothing is `VERIFIED`. Everything below is `UNVERIFIED` unless marked `BLOCKED` or `DEFERRED`.

### Student
Authentication `VERIFIED` (real Supabase, T013/T014) · Onboarding `VERIFIED` (mock/local-only
persistence) · Dashboard `VERIFIED` (mock data) · Practice Zone `VERIFIED` (Psychology TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT,
standard SSB timing per B4; Interview is an explicit stub — no activities are specced for it yet) ·
Practice submission `VERIFIED` (idempotency-keyed mock submission, retry-safe) · AI feedback `BLOCKED`
(B3 — AI provider not yet decided) · AI failure handling `BLOCKED` (same) · Progress `VERIFIED` (mock
data, zero/populated states) · Resources `VERIFIED` (mock content, list/detail/read-state) · Day 2
Resources `VERIFIED` — curated, human-verified external resource library (TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT/Full Day 2;
`lib/mock/day2-resources.ts`, sourced from `docs/day2-final-curated-resources.md`) restructured 2026-
09-22 into a hub-and-spoke IA: `/student/resources/day-2` is orientation-only (hero, TAT→WAT→SRT→SDT→
Full Day 2 journey, "New to Day 2?" guided flow, a 5-card category grid) and each test has its own page
at `/student/resources/day-2/[tat|wat|srt|sd-sdt|full-day]` showing only that test's resources, grouped
by Study Guides/Examples/Practice/Videos/Feedback (only non-empty groups render) with its own search +
group filter (`components/student/day2/`, `lib/day2/categories.ts`); real auth-gated like the rest of
`/student/*`, no dev bypass · Profile `VERIFIED` (edit form, localStorage-persisted) · **5-Day SSB Practice Journey (T039) `VERIFIED`**
(un-deferred 2026-09-20; full signup→Day1-5 walkthrough in a production build, zero console/page
errors; mock content, localStorage progress tracking, same pattern as Resources)

### Mentor
Authentication `VERIFIED` (real Supabase, T013/T014) · Dashboard `VERIFIED` (mock data) · Mentees
`VERIFIED` (mock data, no real assignment scoping yet) · Mentee detail `VERIFIED` (404 on unknown id;
no real ownership check without auth) · Evaluations `VERIFIED` (Server Action, idempotent, draft
recoverable) · Basic sessions `VERIFIED` (create/cancel via Server Action) · Profile `VERIFIED`
(localStorage-persisted)

### Academy Admin
Authentication `VERIFIED` (real Supabase, T013/T014) · Dashboard `VERIFIED` (mock data, alerts,
attention list) · Students `VERIFIED` (add, status, batch reassignment via Server Actions) · Batches
`VERIFIED` (create, member add/remove, mentor assignment) · Mentors `VERIFIED` (invite, invited vs.
active distinction) · Reports `VERIFIED` (readiness distribution, batch performance, activity, mentor
workload) · Settings `VERIFIED` (Server Action, server-side mock persistence)

## 6. Known Bugs

**None recorded.** This is not a claim that none exist — no code has been inspected. The first real
bug list comes out of T001, T060 and T065.

---

## 7. Blockers

### B1 — Backend API contract — `PARTIALLY RESOLVED` (2026-09-18)
Supabase (Postgres) selected as the backend/DB via the B2 decision. Auth, users, students, mentors,
academies and batches can now be modeled as real Postgres tables with Row Level Security enforcing
academy isolation (`AGENTS.md` §10) — auth-adjacent data no longer needs a frontend-only interim
contract. Practice, submissions, evaluations, AI feedback and progress still need their schemas
defined; each still needs request/response/error shapes and authorization rules worked out per
feature as those tasks are reached.
**Interim rule (still applies to non-auth domains):** define types frontend-side in `types/` and
treat them as the working contract until their Supabase schema is designed.
**Blocks:** Phases 3–5 integration for domains beyond auth/users/academies/batches.

### B2 — Authentication provider — `RESOLVED` (2026-09-18), `IMPLEMENTED` (2026-09-19)
**Decision:** Supabase Auth. See Decisions Register. T013/T014 were deliberately sequenced later
(2026-09-18 decision) so the Student/Mentor/Academy UIs could be reviewed on mock data first, then
built for real on 2026-09-19 once all three existed to wire it into.

### B3 — AI provider — `BLOCKED`
The frontend must consume an application-level AI feedback API. Provider credentials never reach the
browser.
**Blocks:** T034, T035 — i.e. the core value loop.

### B4 — Practice timing rules — `RESOLVED` (2026-09-18)
**Decision (standard SSB timing):**
- TAT: 30s stimulus display per picture, then a 4-minute writing window. 12 pictures + 1 blank slide.
- WAT: 15s per word, 60 words, one word shown at a time in rapid sequence.
- SRT: 30 minutes total to respond to 60 situations.
- SDT: 15 minutes total across 5 self-description prompts.
**Unblocks:** T032 (Practice Zone — Psychology tests).

### B5 — Storage — `BLOCKED`
Finalise when document / audio / resource workflows are implemented. Not blocking the MVP loop.

### B6 — Payments — `DEFERRED`
Not required to validate the MVP. Pricing page shows information and CTAs only.

## 8. Decisions Register

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-16 | Glass Capsule design system is mandatory project-wide (`AGENTS.md` §7) | Supplied as a project-wide requirement, not a suggestion |
| 2026-09-16 | Navy is the primary brand colour; purple is no longer a brand accent | Resolves conflict with the earlier colour-semantics rule |
| 2026-09-16 | Capsule-first replaces card-first layout | Resolves conflict with earlier "rounded cards" guidance |
| 2026-09-16 | `CLAUDE.md` retired; `AGENTS.md` authoritative | Three files pointed at a file that is not maintained |
| 2026-09-16 | Achievements and Leaderboard removed from MVP dashboard (P2) | They were specified and simultaneously listed as not started |
| 2026-09-16 | "Today's Mission" (MVP) split from the "5-Day SSB Mission" programme (P1) | Design brief and scope list conflicted on the word "Mission" |
| 2026-09-16 | Media-player / watch-room / playback-sync requirements excluded | Belong to a different project; no such feature exists here |
| 2026-09-16 | Frontend-defined types serve as the interim API contract | Unblocks UI work without scattering backend assumptions |
| 2026-09-16 | Project scaffolded with `create-next-app` (App Router, TS strict, Tailwind, ESLint), package name `ssb-academy` | Standard, supported tooling for the mandated stack (`AGENTS.md` §3); confirmed with user that "from scratch" meant no pre-existing code, not hand-authoring config |
| 2026-09-16 | Capsule icons are passed as string names (`icon="mission"`) resolved against a registry in `components/ui/capsule.tsx`, never as a component reference or JSX element prop | Next.js 16 / React 19 cannot serialize a Lucide icon (forwardRef component) across the Server→Client Component boundary as a custom prop; confirmed by reproducing both failure modes during T004. All capsule call sites (mostly Server Components) must use this pattern |
| 2026-09-16 | `.glass-surface`/`.glass-surface--*` state modifiers (selected/success/error/focus-visible) are written as plain CSS in `app/globals.css`, never as Tailwind utility classes on a component | `.glass-surface` sets `background`/`border`/`box-shadow` outside any Tailwind `@layer`, so those unlayered declarations always beat layered Tailwind utilities for the same properties regardless of class order — found via visual QA in T004 (selected/success/error/focus states were invisible until fixed). Any new glass-surface-based component must add state styling next to `.glass-surface` in CSS, not via `border-*`/`bg-*`/`shadow-*`/`ring-*` utility classes |
| 2026-09-16 | shadcn/ui installed with `-b radix -p nova` (Radix primitives, "Nova - Lucide/Geist" preset); its default neutral-gray tokens (`--primary`, `--border`, `--ring`, etc.) were remapped in `app/globals.css` to reference the existing navy/status tokens instead of being left as-is | shadcn init writes its own generic palette into `:root`, which would have silently produced black/gray buttons and inputs instead of the mandated navy branding (`AGENTS.md` §7.5) — a second, competing design system rather than one. `.dark`/chart/sidebar tokens were dropped as unused (no dark mode requirement; no chart or shadcn-sidebar component built yet) |
| 2026-09-16 | Project standardized on the official `cn` npm package (`shadcn-ui/cn`) for className merging everywhere, not a hand-rolled `clsx`+`tailwind-merge` wrapper | Every file shadcn's CLI generates hardcodes `import { cn } from "cn"` regardless of the `utils` alias in `components.json` — fighting that on every future `shadcn add` would be constant, losing maintenance work. `lib/utils/cn.ts` and the `clsx`/`tailwind-merge` deps from T004 were removed; `components/ui/capsule.tsx` now imports from `"cn"` directly, matching every shadcn-generated component |
| 2026-09-18 | Supabase (Auth + Postgres) selected to resolve B2 (auth provider) and partially resolve B1 (backend contract) | User chose it explicitly over NextAuth.js, Clerk, and a fully custom backend, specifically because it also supplies a real Postgres database with Row Level Security, letting academy isolation (`AGENTS.md` §10) be enforced at the data layer rather than only in application code. Unblocks T013/T014 |
| 2026-09-18 | T013/T014 (real authentication + server-side authorization) intentionally **deferred**; screens/features build next on mock data, without a login wall, so the product's look and behaviour can be reviewed end-to-end sooner | User's explicit instruction: build out the rest of the site first and "add login for each" once the whole project is more complete, rather than gating every screen behind auth immediately. This does **not** change the auth model decided above (still Supabase) and does not permit mock/fake data to silently ship — `AGENTS.md` §8's mock-data rules (isolated, clearly named, shaped like the eventual API response) still apply, and no page may claim to be authorization-checked until T013/T014 are actually done |
| 2026-09-18 | B4 resolved: standard SSB timing — TAT 30s/picture + 4min writing (12 pictures + 1 blank), WAT 15s/word for 60 words, SRT 30min for 60 situations, SDT 15min across 5 prompts | User chose the standard, widely-used SSB convention over an untimed practice mode, so reps build real exam-pressure habits and stay comparable across students. Unblocks T032 |
| 2026-09-19 | T013/T014 built for real: Supabase Auth (`@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr`), `middleware.ts` enforcing role-based route access, RLS on `profiles`/`academies`, real login/signup/logout/forgot-password/reset-password pages | Sequencing decision from 2026-09-18 reached its trigger condition — all three role UIs existed to wire auth into. User provided a live Supabase project's URL + anon key + service role key this session |
| 2026-09-19 | No email confirmation required on signup (Supabase dashboard setting, not code) | User's explicit choice, to keep local testing fast; can be turned on later without any code change |
| 2026-09-19 | Public signup offers **Student** and **Academy Admin** only. **Mentor accounts are invite-only** — an academy admin invites a mentor from `/academy/mentors`, which now creates a **real** Supabase account via `admin.inviteUserByEmail` (service-role key, server-side only) | Matches `specs.md` §8.5 exactly (mentors are invited, not self-signup). User explicitly asked for this to be real rather than mocked, unlike the rest of the academy domain — see Technical Debt for the mock/real bridge this required |
| 2026-09-19 | Each role's Settings-equivalent page (Academy → Settings, Mentor → Profile, Student → Profile) gained "Load demo data" / "Clear demo data" controls | User's request: once real auth exists, every new account starts genuinely empty, losing the rich populated mock view built during T031/T040/T050. For Mentor/Academy this resets the shared in-memory mock arrays to their original snapshot (Server Actions in `lib/actions/{mentor,academy}.ts`, snapshotted at module load in `lib/mock/{mentor,academy}.ts`); for Student (no shared mutable mock state) it clears the relevant `localStorage` keys instead |
| 2026-09-19 | Design system replaced app-wide: "Glass Capsule" (`AGENTS.md` §7, navy accent, `CapsulePrimary/Secondary/Small`) → **Apple-Inspired Glass UI v3** (indigo `--brand-accent`, three glass material tiers, sidebar+header app shell, stat cards/list-tables instead of capsule hierarchy). Full spec: `UI design.md` (repo root, descriptive reference, not a governing file). `AGENTS.md` §7 rewritten in full to be the binding summary | User provided a complete, detailed design doc and explicitly confirmed: (1) applies to the whole app, not just Academy Admin (even though the doc's own nav list — Dashboard/Students/Batches/Mentors/Reports/Settings — matches Academy's nav exactly), and (2) `AGENTS.md` should be updated to reflect it as the new mandatory system, the same way Glass Capsule itself superseded an earlier rounded-cards/purple direction |
| 2026-09-22 | Day 2 Resources gets five **per-category accent colours** (`--day2-tat`/`wat`/`srt`/`sdt`/`full`, `app/globals.css`) — a deliberate, scoped exception to `AGENTS.md` §7.1's "no section-specific accent colour" rule, for the Day 2 test identity only. Restrained (a thin card-top line, icon tint, ~7% background wash, hover border, that test's own CTA — never a full-card/full-icon fill); every other section of the product stays governed by the single `--brand-accent` system | User's explicit redesign brief (2026-09-22) asked for a distinct, tasteful accent per TAT/WAT/SRT/SD-SDT/Full Day 2 ("images should have visual identity... introduce tasteful colour... NOT giant neon blocks... still professional"), directly and knowingly in tension with §7.1. Per `AGENTS.md` §0's conflict-resolution order, a direct, explicit, current user instruction on product/visual scope for one named section outranks the standing rule for that section; recorded here rather than silently applied |
| 2026-09-20 | The 5-Day SSB Mission programme, deferred (P1) since 2026-09-16, is **un-deferred and built as T039 "5-Day SSB Practice Journey"** | Explicit user direction, referencing Target SSB (targetssb.in) as functional/structural inspiration (content and information architecture only — the existing Apple-Inspired Glass UI v3 design system governs the actual UI, per user instruction to fix visual consistency later). `specs.md` §3/§6.4a/§13 updated to record the reversal rather than silently ignoring the prior deferred status |
| 2026-09-20 | T039's practice-mode banks track per-item completion under `(dayId, moduleId, itemId)` in a new `ssb-journey-progress` localStorage key; test-mode banks (single timed submission) are deliberately excluded from that tracking and from all progress totals | A test is pass/fail-once, not incrementally completable — including its items in a "done" count would permanently dilute the percentage with items that can never individually be marked done. Found and fixed during manual verification: an earlier version wrongly used "has an `href`" as the exclusion signal instead of "is test-mode", which incorrectly excluded Personal Interview (a practice-mode bank that happens to link to an existing route) from Day 4's progress entirely |
| 2026-09-20 | Client components deriving from `ssb-journey-progress` (the progress ring, module badges, the final summary, the self-assessment checklist, the bank practice runner) all initialize state to the SSR-safe default and populate the real value in a post-mount `useEffect`, with a targeted `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` on each — not a `useState` lazy initializer | A lazy initializer still re-runs during the client's hydration render, which happens *before* React finishes reconciling against the server HTML — so it reads real localStorage data at exactly the moment hydration is comparing text content, producing React error #418 the first time any progress exists. Confirmed via a full Playwright-driven signup-to-final-progress walkthrough in a production build; the bug reproduced consistently and was fixed by moving each read into `useEffect`, matching the pattern eslint's own rule description recommends ("subscribe for updates from external system, calling setState in a callback") |
| 2026-09-21 | Merged `origin/main` (PR #1, T066 critical test suite) into `feat/5-day-ssb-practice-journey`. `status.md` conflicted in two places — the §1 state-summary table (`Tests`/`Next action` rows) and the §13a dated log (both branches appended an entry under the same `Date: 2026-09-20` line). Resolved by **union, not override**: both branches' facts are true simultaneously (T039 shipped *and* a real test suite now exists), so nothing was discarded. The log's two same-day entries were split into separate `Date:` blocks and ordered T039 → T066 → T039 follow-up (2026-09-21) to keep it chronological. `task.md` merged automatically with no conflict | Per `AGENTS.md` §0/§20: status.md is a reporting file, never a source of requirements, and must reflect exact current state — picking one branch's version would have silently deleted verified facts from the other. Recorded here per §0's instruction to log conflict resolutions in the Decisions Register |
| 2026-09-21 | Landing page's role "Preview" links, removed 2026-09-19 when real auth shipped, were **restored in a different form**: `/dev-preview/[role]` (`app/dev-preview/[role]/route.ts`, `lib/auth/dev-preview.ts`) signs in as a seeded demo account per role via real Supabase auth, rather than bypassing auth. Hard-gated on `NODE_ENV !== "production"` (route 404s and the landing-page links don't render otherwise) | Real auth + middleware (T013/T014) turned the old no-login preview links into dead links (they'd just bounce to `/login`), which made repeated manual role-testing slow. A real seeded session (not a bypass) means every downstream authorization/RLS check still runs exactly as it does for a real user, so this cannot mask an authorization bug the way a client-side bypass would |
| 2026-09-21 | Fixed `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to also handle Supabase's `token_hash`+`type` email-link format, not only the PKCE `code` format | Server-initiated email links (mentor invites, password resets) have no browser-held PKCE verifier to exchange, so Supabase issues them as `token_hash`+`type` instead of `code` — the callback only handled `code`, so every invite/reset link landed on "link invalid or expired" (first surfaced as bug S49, 2026-09-19). `redirectTo` was also pointed at the final destination directly, to match the `token_hash` email template variable. Affects `lib/actions/academy.ts` (mentor invite) and `lib/api/auth.ts` (password reset) |
| 2026-09-22 | Merged `origin/main` (PR #2, `feat/5-day-ssb-practice-journey` — T039 content-depth follow-up, already covered above) into local `main`, alongside the two local-only commits above (dev-preview restore, auth-callback token_hash fix). No file overlap between the two sides, so `git merge` produced a clean merge with zero conflicts; `npm run build` verified clean afterward | Routine sync — local `main` and `origin/main` had diverged (2 local commits, 4 remote commits) since the previous merge on 2026-09-21 |
| 2026-09-24 | **Academy section gets its own design language** (dark navy sidebar, white cards, indigo primary, restrained gold brand accent), scoped to a `.academy-app` wrapper in `app/globals.css`. Explicit, user-approved scoped deviation from the Glass UI v3 *material* in `AGENTS.md` §7 — `AGENTS.md` itself is unchanged. Student/Mentor keep Glass UI v3 and `components/layout/*`. Inside `.academy-app`, `.glass-*` classes resolve to solid white hairline-bordered cards (no backdrop blur), so existing shared components render consistently | Product still in early design phase; reference dashboard supplied as the primary visual direction. Scoping avoids a half-migrated app and leaves a single place to promote the tokens to `:root` when Student/Mentor adopt them |
| 2026-09-24 | Academy dashboard keeps its existing data contract (`getDashboardData`/`getStudents`/`getMentors` in `lib/api/academy.ts`, backed by in-memory `lib/mock/academy.ts`). **Correction to the brief:** this data is the isolated pre-backend mock, not Supabase — only auth/profile/academy name come from Supabase. Widgets with no data source (performance trend line, assessment radar, upcoming sessions, KPI month-over-month deltas) were deliberately **not built** rather than fabricated (`AGENTS.md` §8) | The existing contract has no time series, assessment-category or session-schedule data. Adding them is an API-contract change that needs approval (§19) |
| 2026-10-03 | Supersedes the 2026-09-24 "not built" note: at user request the dashboard now matches the reference layout, and the trend line, assessment radar and upcoming sessions **are built**, fed by `getAnalytics()` → isolated `lib/mock/academy-analytics.ts` with `source: "demo"`. Each such panel shows a visible "Demo data" badge. The reference's "Activity Completion" KPI is shown as the real "Active Students" share; "Avg. Performance" is the real average readiness % | `AGENTS.md` §8 allows isolated, clearly-labelled mock data shaped like the API response while the backend is missing. `source` lets the UI drop the badge automatically once real tables exist |
| 2026-10-04 | **Batches are the first Academy domain on real Supabase.** New migration `supabase/migrations/0003_batches.sql` (table `batches`: academy_id, name, mentor_id → profiles, status enum active/archived, start_date, created_at; unique name per academy; RLS for the academy admin; `current_admin_academy_id()` / `mentor_in_academy()` helpers; a new `profiles_select_academy_admin` policy so admins can read their academy's mentors). Reads/writes use the admin's own session (anon key + RLS), never the service-role key. **No delete policy:** batches are archived, so future student→batch links can't be orphaned. The Batches page no longer shares data with the dashboard/Students/batch-detail pages, which still read the in-memory batches (`lib/mock/academy.ts`) until students move to Postgres | User chose "write the migration, then build on it". Student counts are intentionally not shown: there is no `students` table, and the in-memory students reference in-memory batch ids, so any count would be fake |

---

| 2026-10-07 | **Content administration gets its own access model, independent of `profiles.role`.** New migration `supabase/migrations/0004_admin_access.sql`: table `admin_grants (user_id, area)` with area enum `super`/`student_content`/`mentor_content`/`academy_content`; RLS so users read only their own grants and only a super admin can insert or delete; `is_super_admin()`/`has_admin_area()` helpers for future content-table policies; super-admin-only SECURITY DEFINER functions `admin_find_user_by_email()` and `admin_list_grants()`, so the service-role key is never used. The first super admin is bootstrapped by hand in SQL. A super admin can't revoke their own `super` grant (enforced in the action and in the RLS delete policy). `/admin` is guarded in middleware by grants, not by role, and every page and action re-checks on the server. `specs.md` §8a added; "admin-side practice authoring" un-deferred from §8.1 | User chose "super-admin plus delegated editors" (2026-10-07). Keeping grants orthogonal to the role enum leaves every existing role guard, RLS policy and signup trigger untouched, avoids Postgres's "unsafe use of new enum value" in the same migration, and lets one person edit several areas. Built first, on its own branch, so the three panel branches (T081–T083) share one access model instead of each inventing one |

## 9. Technical Debt

| Introduced | Debt | Removed by |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-18 | ~~`/student`, `/mentor`, `/academy` (T020–T022 onward) had **no server-side auth guard**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-19** by `middleware.ts` (T013/T014). | T013 + T014 — done |
| 2026-09-18 | Screens built under this sequencing (T020–T052) read from isolated mock data modules, not a real backend, per `AGENTS.md` §8. **Still open** — auth (T013/T014) is real, but student/mentee/batch/evaluation/session/resource content is still mock, in-memory, and per-server-process rather than per-academy-isolated Postgres. | Full backend data migration — not scheduled as a task yet; needed before Phase 6's academy-isolation audit (T060) can pass |
| 2026-09-19 | ~~`/mentor/*` had the same no-auth-guard gap~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-19**. The mentor→mentee *assignment* check (i.e. "is this actually your mentee") is still not real, since mentees are still mock data (see the row above). Evaluation/session mutations use Next.js Server Actions specifically so they mutate the real server-side mock state (not a client-only copy) — a real bug caught and fixed during T043/T044. | Auth guard: done. Real assignment scoping: same backend migration as above |
| 2026-09-19 | ~~`/academy/*` had the same no-auth-guard gap~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-19**. Per-academy data isolation is still not real: there is exactly one academy in the mock dataset (`lib/mock/academy.ts`), so a second real academy_admin account would see the same mock students/batches/mentors as the first. All mutations (add student, assign batch/mentor, invite mentor, update settings) are Server Actions. | Auth guard: done. Per-academy isolation: same backend migration as above (`AGENTS.md` §10) |
| 2026-09-19 | Mentor invites are a hybrid: `inviteMentorAction` creates a **real** Supabase auth user (service-role `admin.inviteUserByEmail`, real email sent) so the person can actually log in as a mentor, but also pushes a matching row into the **mock** `lib/mock/academy.ts` `MENTORS` array purely so the existing mock-backed mentor list/dashboard/batch-assignment UI shows them immediately. `app/mentor/layout.tsx` flips that mock row from "invited" to "active" the first time the real mentor loads their own dashboard. This bridge is deliberate, not an oversight — documented in code comments in both files. | Same backend migration as the rows above; once academy data is real Postgres, drop the mock-array half of this function entirely |
| 2026-09-19 | Landing page's temporary "Preview (no login yet)" buttons on all three role cards were removed now that `/login`/`/signup` are real. | Done — removed in the same change that shipped T013/T014 |
| 2026-09-19 | Design system migration covered every page/component for the *material* system (glass tiers, colour, radius, shadow, shell) and the primary reference screens (all three dashboards, mentee detail, practice list pages) got the full new content-pattern treatment (`StatCard`/`ListPanel`/`PageHeader`). Secondary pages (batches, students, mentors, reports, settings, evaluations, sessions, resources detail, progress) were swept for token correctness and typography-scale consistency but still use ad-hoc `glass-regular` divs in places `StatCard`/`ListPanel` would be a cleaner fit. Dropdown menus (profile menu, `<Select>`) still use shadcn's default solid chrome, not an explicit `glass-thick` treatment. | A future T070-equivalent consistency pass — visually acceptable now, not yet swept against every §7.13 acceptance-test item on every screen |
| 2026-09-20 | T039 (5-Day SSB Practice Journey) module/day grid cards are hand-built `glass-regular` cards (matching Target SSB's reference layout) rather than the shared `StatCard`/`ListPanel` components used elsewhere in Practice/Resources. Content banks (OIR verbal/non-verbal MCQs, PPDT, interview/conference questions) are small realistic placeholder sets, not a production-scale content bank, and use the same localStorage-only, per-browser progress tracking as `lib/student/resource-completion.ts` (not account-scoped — same root cause as the row above). No mentor/academy visibility into a student's journey progress exists. AI feedback on journey submissions is not wired up (blocked on B3, same as T034). | Same future T070 pass could fold the day/module cards into `StatCard`; same backend migration as the rows above would make progress account-scoped; mentor/academy visibility and AI feedback are new scope, not yet a task |



| 2026-09-22 | ~~`lib/auth/session.ts` and `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` carried a temporary dev-only bypass (`x-day2-dev-bypass` header) added so `/student/resources/day-2` could be previewed locally without a configured Supabase project. It only activated under `NODE_ENV=development` for that exact path, but shipped no real user/session and was explicitly marked `TEMPORARY — remove before committing`.~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-22**, both files reverted to their committed, bypass-free state (`git checkout`); confirmed no other reference to `x-day2-dev-bypass`/`DEV_BYPASS_PATH` remains in the repo. | Removed 2026-09-22 |
| 2026-09-20 | T039 (5-Day SSB Practice Journey) module/day grid cards are hand-built `glass-regular` cards (matching Target SSB's reference layout) rather than the shared `StatCard`/`ListPanel` components used elsewhere in Practice/Resources. Content banks (OIR verbal/non-verbal MCQs, PPDT, interview/conference questions) are small realistic placeholder sets, not a production-scale content bank, and use the same localStorage-only, per-browser progress tracking as `lib/student/resource-completion.ts` (not account-scoped — same root cause as the row above).

## 11. Priority Queue

**Re-sequenced 2026-09-18** — auth (T013/T014) moved to just before the quality/security audits
instead of right after the public shell. Rationale: user wants to see and review the built-out product
end to end first; every screen below is built on isolated mock data per `AGENTS.md` §8 until real auth
lands. No screen may be presented as authorization-checked before then.

## 13a. Update Log

```text
Date: 2026-09-18
Task: T020, T030, T031 — Student layout, onboarding, dashboard
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- app/student/layout.tsx, components/student/student-header.tsx, components/student/student-nav.tsx:
  Student shell with Dashboard/Practice/Progress/Resources/Profile nav (CapsuleSmall), notifications
  popover (empty state), profile dropdown menu. Installed shadcn dropdown-menu + popover.
- components/ui/capsule.tsx: added dashboard/resources/profile icons to the registry.
- app/onboarding/page.tsx, components/student/onboarding-form.tsx: onboarding form with validation,
  localStorage draft persistence, client-side completion flag.
- app/student/page.tsx: dashboard with zero-activity and populated (?preview=active) states.
- app/student/{practice,progress,resources,profile}/page.tsx: "coming soon" stubs.
- types/student.ts, lib/mock/student.ts, lib/api/student.ts: student domain contract + isolated mock
  data + API client per AGENTS.md §8/§9.

What remains:
- T032/T033 Practice Zone — blocked on B4 (timing rules).
- T021/T022 Mentor/Academy layouts not started.
- Real auth (T013/T014) — deferred by decision, not started.

Blocker:
- B4 (TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT timing rules undecided) blocks T032.

Next task:
- T032 — Practice Zone (needs B4 decided first).
```

```text
Date: 2026-09-18
Task: T032, T033, T036, T037, T038 — Practice Zone, submission, progress, resources, profile
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- B4 resolved: standard SSB timing (TAT 30s/pic+4min write ×12+1, WAT 15s/word ×60, SRT 30min/60,
  SDT 15min/5). lib/practice/config.ts encodes it.
- types/practice.ts, lib/mock/practice.ts, lib/api/practice.ts: practice domain + mock content
  (12 TAT scenes as text descriptions — no image pipeline yet, B5 — + 60 WAT words + 60 SRT
  situations + 5 standard SDT prompts) + idempotency-keyed submission API.
- hooks/use-countdown.ts, components/practice/carousel-runner.tsx (TAT/WAT),
  components/practice/budget-runner.tsx (SRT/SDT), components/practice/practice-session.tsx:
  instructions → timed response → submit → confirmation flow, beforeunload guard while in progress,
  retry-safe error state that never loses responses.
- app/student/practice/page.tsx, .../psychology/page.tsx, .../psychology/[test]/page.tsx,
  .../interview/page.tsx: category → activity list → session pages.
- types/progress.ts, lib/mock/progress.ts, lib/api/progress.ts, app/student/progress/page.tsx:
  real Progress page (readiness, trend, skill areas, improvement areas, activity history).
- types/resources.ts, lib/mock/resources.ts, lib/api/resources.ts,
  components/student/resource-read-badge.tsx, resource-read-toggle.tsx,
  lib/student/resource-completion.ts, app/student/resources/page.tsx + [slug]/page.tsx: real
  Resources list/detail with a persisted (localStorage) read state.
- lib/student/profile-storage.ts, components/student/profile-form.tsx,
  app/student/profile/page.tsx: real editable Profile form, validated, localStorage-persisted.

What remains:
- T034/T035 AI feedback — blocked on B3 (AI provider decision, not yet raised with the user).
- T021/T022 Mentor/Academy layouts not started.
- Real auth (T013/T014) — deferred by decision, not started.
- Interview practice has no spec'd activities — left as an explicit stub, not fabricated content.

Blocker:
- B3 (AI provider undecided) blocks T034/T035 — the only remaining gap in the Student section.

Next task:
- Resolve B3, or move to Mentor (T021/T040+) / Academy (T022/T050+).
```

```text
Date: 2026-09-19
Task: T021, T040–T045 — Mentor layout, dashboard, mentees, evaluations, sessions, profile
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- types/mentor.ts, lib/mock/mentor.ts (6 mentees, 3 evaluations, 2 sessions, mentor "Kavita Sharma"
  — same name as the student dashboard's mock upcoming session, for continuity), lib/api/mentor.ts
  (read-only client).
- lib/actions/mentor.ts: submitEvaluationAction, createSessionAction, cancelSessionAction as Next.js
  Server Actions with revalidatePath — NOT plain functions. A plain async function called from a
  Client Component would have mutated the client's own bundled copy of lib/mock/mentor.ts, invisible
  to every server-rendered mentor page. Caught this before shipping it; documented in both files.
- lib/mock/mentor.ts: menteeSummaries converted from a precomputed array to getMenteeSummaries(), for
  the same reason — a one-time .map() would have frozen stale evaluationStatus values.
- components/mentor/{mentor-header,mentor-nav}.tsx, app/mentor/layout.tsx: mirrors the student shell.
- app/mentor/page.tsx: dashboard (mentee count, sessions, pending evaluations, average score,
  attention list with stated reasons, today's schedule, progress overview, recent evaluations).
- app/mentor/mentees/page.tsx + [id]/page.tsx: list + detail (404 on unknown id; AI feedback section
  is an honest empty state, not fabricated, since T034 isn't built).
- app/mentor/evaluations/page.tsx + new/page.tsx, components/mentor/evaluation-form.tsx:
  idempotency-keyed submission, localStorage draft recovery per mentee.
- app/mentor/sessions/page.tsx, components/mentor/sessions-view.tsx: create/cancel, reflected
  immediately via router.refresh() + revalidatePath.
- lib/mentor/profile-storage.ts, components/mentor/profile-form.tsx, app/mentor/profile/page.tsx.

What remains:
- T034/T035 AI feedback — still blocked on B3.
- T022/T050+ Academy experience not started.
- Real auth (T013/T014) — deferred by decision, not started.

Blocker:
- B3 (AI provider undecided) — the only remaining Student-side gap; doesn't block Mentor or Academy.

Next task:
- Academy experience (T022, T050+), or resolve B3.
```

```text
Date: 2026-09-19
Task: T022, T050–T055 — Academy layout, dashboard, students, batches, mentors, reports, settings
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- types/academy.ts, lib/mock/academy.ts (8 students, 3 batches, 2 mentors — one active, one
  invited-not-accepted — academy "Horizon SSB Academy", same name already used in the student/mentor
  mock data for continuity), lib/api/academy.ts (reads), lib/actions/academy.ts (Server Actions:
  addStudentAction, setStudentStatusAction, assignStudentBatchAction, createBatchAction,
  assignBatchMentorAction, removeStudentFromBatchAction, inviteMentorAction, updateSettingsAction —
  same Server Action pattern as lib/actions/mentor.ts, applied from the start this time).
- components/academy/{academy-header,academy-nav}.tsx, app/academy/layout.tsx: mirrors
  student/mentor shells.
- app/academy/page.tsx: dashboard (totals, alerts for unmentored batches / pending invites, students
  needing attention, batch performance, mentor overview, quick-action capsules).
- app/academy/students/page.tsx + [id]/page.tsx: list, add-student form, detail with batch
  reassignment and active/inactive toggle.
- app/academy/batches/page.tsx + [id]/page.tsx: list, create-batch form, detail with mentor
  assignment and member add/remove (removing preserves the student's own record, doesn't delete it).
- app/academy/mentors/page.tsx: list + invite form; invited mentors visibly distinguished from active.
- app/academy/reports/page.tsx: readiness distribution, batch performance, activity summary, mentor
  workload — each states insufficient data plainly rather than faking a chart.
- app/academy/settings/page.tsx: academy name / contact email / admin name, Server Action-backed.
- Added a third "Preview (no login yet)" button to the landing page's "For Academies" card, linking
  to /academy — matching the student and mentor ones already there.

What remains:
- T034/T035 AI feedback — still blocked on B3. This is now the only unbuilt MVP feature area.
- Real auth (T013/T014) — deferred by decision, not started.
- Phase 6 quality/security audits (T060–T066) — not started; the no-auth-guard gap across all three
  role areas is the main thing they'll need to close.

Blocker:
- B3 (AI provider undecided).

Next task:
- Resolve B3 (AI feedback), or move to T013/T014 (real auth) now that all three role UIs exist to
  wire it into.

Task: T013, T014 — Real authentication + role-based access control
Status: Complete (verified — build/lint/type-check + middleware smoke-tested; real signup/login not
yet click-tested in a browser by the agent this session, no Chrome extension connection)

What changed:
- Installed @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/ssr.
- .env.local (gitignored): NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY — real project credentials, provided by the user.
- lib/supabase/{client,server,admin}.ts: browser/server/service-role Supabase clients.
- supabase/migrations/0001_init_auth.sql: user_role enum, academies + profiles tables, RLS
  (self-access + academy-member read), handle_new_user trigger (creates a profile, and an academy
  row for academy_admin signups, from auth signup metadata). User must run this in the Supabase SQL
  Editor — it is not applied automatically.
- types/auth.ts, lib/api/auth.ts: signUp/logIn/requestPasswordReset/updatePassword + validation.
- lib/auth/session.ts (getCurrentUserAndProfile), lib/auth/actions.ts (logoutAction Server Action),
  lib/auth/redirect.ts (dashboardPathForRole).
- lib/supabase/middleware.ts + middleware.ts (T014): maps /onboarding + /student → student,
  /mentor → mentor, /academy → academy_admin; unauthenticated → /login?reason=login_required;
  wrong role → /forbidden. Verified with curl (all four protected prefixes redirect correctly when
  logged out).
- app/forbidden/page.tsx, app/auth/callback/route.ts (exchanges the Supabase email-link code for a
  session, used by both password reset and mentor-invite acceptance).
- components/auth/{login-form,signup-form,forgot-password-form,reset-password-form}.tsx replacing
  the placeholder /login and /signup pages; added /forgot-password and /reset-password pages.
- Signup offers Student / Academy Admin only (Mentor is invite-only, per specs.md §8.5 — user
  decision, not inferred).
- Real mentor invites: lib/actions/academy.ts inviteMentorAction now calls
  admin.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail (service-role client) to create an actual Supabase account and
  send a real invite email, in addition to the existing mock MENTORS entry (documented bridge — see
  Technical Debt). app/mentor/layout.tsx flips that mock entry from "invited" to "active" the first
  time the real mentor's own dashboard loads.
- Student/Mentor/Academy headers: real signed-in user's name (via getCurrentUserAndProfile) replaces
  the mock name constants; added a real "Log out" item to each profile dropdown (logoutAction).
- "Load demo data" / "Clear demo data": lib/mock/{mentor,academy}.ts snapshot their initial arrays
  at module load; Server Actions reset or empty the live arrays from that snapshot. Wired into
  Academy → Settings and Mentor → Profile. Student has no shared mutable mock state, so
  components/student/reset-local-data.tsx clears the relevant localStorage keys instead, on
  Student → Profile.
- Removed the three temporary "Preview (no login yet)" homepage buttons — real login/signup replace
  them as the entry path.

What remains:
- T034/T035 AI feedback — still blocked on B3. Only remaining MVP feature gap.
- Per-academy data isolation for students/mentees/batches/evaluations/sessions — still mock,
  in-memory, shared across every real account (Technical Debt). Needed before T060 can pass.
- User has not yet run the SQL migration or click-tested signup/login in a browser as of this
  entry — first attempt hit /forbidden because the migration hadn't been run yet (no profiles
  table), which is now understood and being retried with a fresh signup.

Blocker:
- B3 (AI provider undecided) — unrelated to auth, was already open.

Next task:
- Confirm real signup/login/logout work end-to-end in the browser (user testing in progress).
- Then resolve B3 (AI feedback), or scope the backend data migration needed to close the
  per-academy-isolation gap before Phase 6.

Task: App-wide design system replacement — "Glass Capsule" → "Apple-Inspired Glass UI v3"
Status: Complete (verified — build/lint/type-check clean; rendered-HTML checks on /, /login, /signup;
not yet visually confirmed in a live browser by the agent, no Chrome extension connection this
session — user should click through /student, /mentor, /academy to confirm)

What changed:
- User supplied a full design spec (`UI design.md`, repo root) and confirmed via direct questions:
  (1) applies app-wide, not just Academy Admin; (2) AGENTS.md §7 should be rewritten to make it the
  new binding system, superseding Glass Capsule in full.
- AGENTS.md §7 fully rewritten (tokens, app shell, page-header pattern, content patterns, typography,
  radius/shadow scale, responsive/accessibility/motion rules, screen acceptance test) plus two stray
  "capsule"/"navy" references elsewhere in the file corrected.
- app/globals.css rewritten: ink/surface/hairline tokens, --brand-accent (named to avoid colliding
  with shadcn's own --accent semantic slot), three glass tiers as plain CSS classes (glass-thin/
  regular/thick — stateful, so CSS not Tailwind utilities, same rule as before), radius scale wired
  into Tailwind's @theme (rounded-control/button/card/panel/pill), shadow-sm/md overridden to spec,
  shadow-glow-accent added, .nav-item / .filter-chip / .row-hover-tint state classes, .ambient-wash
  keyframe background. shadcn semantic tokens (--primary, --ring, etc.) remapped onto the new tokens.
- New shared layout: components/layout/{app-shell,sidebar,top-header,mobile-tab-bar}.tsx — one shell
  used identically by Student/Mentor/Academy layouts, replacing three separate per-role header/nav
  component sets (deleted).
- New shared content components: components/ui/{stat-card,page-header,list-panel,filter-chip,
  detail-header,status-tag,nav-icons}.tsx; empty-state/error-state/loading-state redesigned in place.
- Retired components/ui/capsule.tsx (CapsulePrimary/Secondary/Small) entirely — 9 call sites migrated
  to the new components (FilterChip for role/stage toggles, ListPanel/ListRow for lists, StatCard for
  metrics, a custom Link card for Today's Mission).
- Full-codebase sweep (56 files) for now-deleted token names (glass-surface, text-text-primary/muted,
  brand-navy*, bg-bg-base/ambient) — mechanical renames where safe, structural rewrites where the old
  Capsule API was in use. Verified zero remaining references by grep after each pass.
- Typography consistency pass: remaining old-scale headers (text-2xl page titles, text-sm section
  headers, text-xs stat labels) bumped to the new 28px/700 · 18px/600 · 11px/600 scale across the
  handful of secondary pages that hadn't already been rewritten with the new shared components.

What remains (see Technical Debt):
- Secondary pages (batches, students, mentors, reports, settings, evaluations, sessions, resources
  detail, progress) still use ad-hoc glass-regular divs in some spots rather than StatCard/ListPanel —
  visually consistent (same tokens) but not yet using the shared components throughout.
- Dropdown menus / <Select> still shadcn's default solid chrome, not explicit glass-thick.
- Live browser visual confirmation still pending (user to check).

Blocker:
- None for this task. B3 (AI provider) remains open and unrelated.

Next task:
- User to visually confirm the redesign in a browser.
- Then: AI feedback (B3), backend data migration for per-academy isolation, or a full T070-style
  consistency pass on the remaining secondary pages.

Task: T039 — 5-Day SSB Practice Journey (un-deferred, built)
Status: Complete (verified — build/lint/type-check clean; full signup-to-final-progress walkthrough
run against a production build via Playwright, zero client console/page errors; see Decisions
Register for two real bugs found and fixed during that verification)

What changed:
- Un-deferred by explicit user direction, referencing Target SSB (targetssb.in) for content/IA only
  (existing Apple-Inspired Glass UI v3 design system governs the actual UI — user said the visuals
  will be reconciled later). `specs.md` §3/§6.4a/§13 and this file's Decisions Register updated to
  record the reversal rather than silently building over the prior "deferred" status.
- `types/ssb-journey.ts`, `lib/mock/ssb-journey.ts` (day/module content — reuses `lib/mock/practice.ts`'s
  WAT/TAT/SRT/SDT item banks for Day 2's Practice modules instead of duplicating them), `lib/api/ssb-journey.ts`
  (typed read layer + a submission function for the new bank tests, kept separate from
  `lib/api/practice.ts`'s existing psychology-specific contract per AGENTS.md §19), `lib/student/ssb-journey-progress.ts`
  (localStorage completion store, same pattern as `resource-completion.ts`).
- `app/student/practice/page.tsx` rewritten as the 5-day overview (progress ring + Day 1–5 list),
  replacing the old flat Psychology/Interview category list.
- `app/student/practice/[day]/page.tsx` (module grid per day) and
  `app/student/practice/[day]/[module]/page.tsx` (generic module dispatcher: reading/info/practice
  bank/timed test/checklist/summary) — one dynamic route pair instead of ~30 near-duplicate pages.
- New components: `journey-progress-ring`, `module-progress-badge`, `bank-practice-runner` (untimed,
  self-paced, mcq or free-text), `mcq-test-runner` (new — timed MCQ test, mirrors `budget-runner.tsx`'s
  structure), `ssb-bank-test-session` (generic test-mode session wrapper, mirrors
  `practice-session.tsx`, reuses the *existing* `carousel-runner.tsx` for PPDT rather than duplicating
  it), `journey-final-summary`, `self-assessment-checklist`.
- `app/student/practice/interview/page.tsx` upgraded from a "coming soon" placeholder to a real
  practice bank (12 questions) — `components/student/coming-soon.tsx` deleted as now-unused.
- Day 2's Test cards and Day 4's Personal Interview card link to the *existing* Psychology/Interview
  routes (`href` override) instead of duplicating that flow; visiting the generic module URL for one
  of those directly now `redirect()`s to the real page instead of rendering empty content.
- `components/ui/nav-icons.tsx`: added `ssbDay`/`oir`/`ppdt`/`gto`/`obstacle`/`command`/`lecture`/
  `conference`/`checklist`/`finalProgress` to the icon registry (AGENTS.md §7.12 — string keys, not
  component references).
- `app/globals.css`: added `.mcq-option[data-selected/correct/incorrect]` modifier classes (plain CSS,
  not conditional Tailwind utilities on a `.glass-thin` base — AGENTS.md §7.12).
- Two real bugs found and fixed during manual verification (see Decisions Register for detail):
  (1) test-mode bank items were being included in progress totals via the wrong exclusion signal
  (`href` presence instead of `mode`), which also wrongly zeroed out Day 4's progress entirely; (2) a
  hydration mismatch (React error #418) in every localStorage-reading client component, fixed by
  moving the read into `useEffect` with an SSR-matching default instead of a `useState` lazy
  initializer.
- Verification method: production build + Playwright (not `npm run dev` — Turbopack's HMR websocket
  fails to complete its handshake in this sandboxed environment, which silently breaks all client-side
  hydration/interactivity in dev mode only; confirmed by reproducing the exact same broken-click
  symptom on the untouched, pre-existing signup form, then confirming it works correctly in a
  production build. Recorded here in case it resurfaces elsewhere in this environment). A disposable
  Supabase test account (`ssb-journey-check-<timestamp>@example.com`) was created during this
  verification and left in the project — no `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` was available this session to
  clean it up via the admin API; harmless, but the user may want to delete it from the Supabase
  dashboard.

What remains (see Technical Debt):
- Content banks are small realistic placeholder sets, not production-scale.
- Progress tracking is localStorage-only (per-browser, not account-scoped) — same root cause as the
  rest of Student's mock-data gap.
- No mentor/academy visibility into a student's journey progress.
- AI feedback on journey submissions: blocked on B3, same as T034.
- Day/module grid cards are hand-built rather than using the shared `StatCard` component.

Blocker:
- None for this task. B3 (AI provider) and the backend migration remain open and unrelated.

Next task:
- User to click through the journey in their own browser to confirm.
- Then: AI feedback (B3), backend data migration for per-academy isolation, or T070-style consistency
  pass (which could now also cover T039's day/module cards).

Task: T066 — Critical testing (started)
Status: In Progress

What changed:
- Installed Vitest 3 + @vitejs/plugin-react + jsdom + React Testing Library + user-event
  (unit/component tests), and @playwright/test + chromium binary (e2e). `vitest.config.ts`,
  `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/setup.ts` added. `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` /
  `npm run test:coverage` / `npm run test:e2e` scripts added to `package.json`.
- `tests/unit/lib/auth-validation.test.ts` (15 cases): validateEmail/validatePassword/
  validateSignupInput/validateLoginInput (`lib/api/auth.ts`).
- `tests/unit/lib/redirect.test.ts` (4 cases): `dashboardPathForRole`.
- `tests/unit/lib/middleware-role.test.ts` (6 cases): the route→role authorization mapping.
  Exported `roleForPath` from `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` (previously module-private) specifically
  so this P0 authorization surface has a direct unit test instead of only indirect coverage through
  `updateSession`. One case documents a **found-not-fixed latent gap**: `startsWith("/mentor")` /
  `startsWith("/student")` are unanchored, so a future top-level route like `/mentorship` would
  silently inherit that role's guard — logged here rather than silently patched, since changing
  matcher behavior wasn't in scope for a testing task.
- `tests/unit/lib/academy-isolation.test.ts`: documents (as passing assertions) that
  `STUDENTS`/`BATCHES`/`MENTORS` in `lib/mock/academy.ts` have no `academyId` field and are shared
  module-level arrays — direct evidence for the Technical Debt row below. `.todo` cases define the
  isolation behavior to enable once real per-academy data lands (T060).
- `tests/unit/components/login-form.test.tsx` (5 cases, RTL + mocked `lib/api/auth`/`next/navigation`):
  reason banners, submit → redirect (role default and explicit `redirectTo`), error display, and
  AGENTS.md §11's "student's input must survive any failure" for a network-error response.
- `tests/e2e/public-pages.spec.ts` + `tests/e2e/auth-guard.spec.ts` (9 cases): `/`, `/login`, `/signup`
  render logged-out; `/student`, `/mentor`, `/academy`, `/onboarding` (incl. nested paths) redirect to
  `/login?reason=login_required&next=<path>` when logged out; `/forbidden` itself is reachable. These
  run against the real middleware and a real (but unauthenticated) Supabase project via `.env.local`.
  Needed `baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000"` (not `localhost`) and Chromium `--no-sandbox` in
  `playwright.config.ts` — `localhost` navigation hung/timed out for every route in this sandboxed
  dev environment even though the same routes responded in well under a second to direct HTTP
  requests; recorded here in case it resurfaces elsewhere.
- `tests/TEST_CASES.md`: full manual + automated test-case index across Auth & Authorization,
  Academy Isolation/IDOR, Student Practice Loop, and Mentor & Academy Workflows, each case tagged
  `VERIFIED`/`MANUAL`/`GAP`/`BLOCKED` with the reason stated, per AGENTS.md §20 ("never write a claim
  about implementation that has not been verified").
- `.gitignore`: added `/test-results`, `/playwright-report`, `/blob-report`, `/playwright/.cache`.
- Verified clean: `npm test` (32 passed, 5 todo), `npx playwright test` (9 passed), `npx tsc --noEmit`,
  `npx eslint .`, `npm run build`.

What remains:
- Not wired into CI yet — T066's acceptance criterion ("runs in CI and fails the build on
  regression") is not met until a pipeline exists to run `npm test` + `npm run test:e2e` on push/PR.
- Most P0/P1 cases in `tests/TEST_CASES.md` §§2, 4, 5 (real-account login/logout, role-mismatch
  `/forbidden` checks, onboarding, practice submission, mentor evaluation persistence, academy
  student/batch/mentor management) are still `MANUAL` — they need either a seeded second real account
  or are straightforward next unit-test targets (e.g. `isDuplicateName`/`assignStudentBatchAction` in
  `lib/actions/academy.ts`) not yet written.
- All of §3 (Academy Isolation/IDOR) is `GAP`, not testable until T060's backend migration.
- `STU-05`/`STU-06` (AI feedback + AI failure handling) blocked on B3, same as the feature itself.

Blocker:
- B3 (AI provider undecided) — blocks STU-05/STU-06 only, not the rest of this task.
- T060 backend migration (not yet scheduled) — blocks all of Academy Isolation/IDOR (§3) and MEN-02.

Next task:
- Wire `npm test` + `npm run test:e2e` into CI so T066's acceptance criterion is actually met.
- Pick off more `MANUAL` cases from `tests/TEST_CASES.md` as unit/component/e2e tests where they
  don't require a live second account or a blocked decision.

Task: Restore production auth + redesign Day 2 Resources UI
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- lib/auth/session.ts, lib/supabase/middleware.ts: reverted to their committed, bypass-free state
  (`git checkout`) — removed a temporary dev-only auth bypass (`x-day2-dev-bypass` header) that had
  been added, out-of-process, purely to preview `/student/resources/day-2` without a configured
  Supabase project. Confirmed no other file referenced it. `/student/resources/day-2` now goes through
  the real Supabase session check + `roleForPath` student-role gate like every other `/student/*`
  route — no special-casing remains anywhere for this path.
- components/student/day2/day2-hero.tsx (new): hero section for `/student/resources/day-2` — title,
  plain-language explanation of Day 2, a TAT → WAT → SRT → SD/SDT flow visual (icons + arrows, CSS/SVG
  only, no stock imagery), Full Day 2 Practice shown as a separate combined option, and the real
  resource count (data-driven, not hardcoded).
- components/student/day2/day2-resource-explorer.tsx: added an "Explore the Day 2 Tests" category-card
  section (icon + short beginner-friendly definition + real per-category resource count + click-to-
  filter, overview-only so its counts never collide on-screen with the filtered-results counter) and a
  "New to Day 2?" recommended step flow (Learn → Examples → Practice → Timed → Feedback, mapped to the
  existing `purpose` taxonomy) inside the existing Start Here section. Renamed the type-browsing
  section from "Browse by Category" to "Browse by Type" now that "category" means TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT
  elsewhere on the page. Added a subtle staggered entrance animation (new `day2-rise-in` utility) to
  the category cards, Start Here grid and the filtered-results region (re-keyed per filter combination
  so it replays as a short transition on search/filter changes, not a full reload).
- components/student/day2/day2-resource-card.tsx: reduced badge density (verification status moved to
  a single top-right tag; access/login folded into one compact meta line, login badge shown only when
  actually required) and gave the external-link CTA a proper button-like glass affordance instead of a
  bare text link, per AGENTS.md §7.5's "avoid excessive badges" guidance. No resource data, URLs or
  descriptions changed.
- app/student/resources/day-2/page.tsx: now renders `Day2Hero` above `Day2ResourceExplorer`; kept the
  existing empty-state and back-link.
- app/globals.css: added `--motion-duration-entrance` token, `.day2-rise-in` (fade + 10px rise, one-
  time/re-triggerable entrance) and `.day2-flow-arrow` (2px-amplitude looping drift on the hero's flow
  arrows, within the §7.6 cap) — both neutralised by the existing global
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` block, no separate reduced-motion handling needed.
- No changes to lib/mock/day2-resources.ts, lib/api/day2-resources.ts or types/day2-resources.ts — the
  curated dataset, its URLs and its descriptions are untouched (AGENTS.md §8/§13).
- Verified clean: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint .`, `npx vitest run` (41 passed, 5 pre-existing
  todo), `npm run build`.

What remains:
- No `.env.local` exists in this environment (no Supabase project configured here), so the restored
  auth flow and the redesigned page could not be exercised in a real browser this session — only
  build/lint/type/unit-test verified. Needs a manual click-through against a real Supabase project
  before sign-off.
- This page (and this whole Day 2 feature) was built as an untracked side change — it has no T0xx
  entry in task.md. Not backfilled here; flagged so it gets a real task entry rather than staying
  permanently off-the-books.

Blocker:
- None for this change. Manual browser verification blocked only by missing local Supabase
  credentials, not by anything in the code.

Next task:
- Add a task.md entry for the Day 2 Resources feature (it predates this session and was never
  tracked) so future changes to it go through the normal task flow.
```

Date: 2026-09-22
Task: T037a — Day 2 Resources information-architecture overhaul
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- Rebuilt the IA from a single-page dump (57 resources on one screen) to a hub-and-spoke structure:
  `/student/resources/day-2` is now orientation-only (no individual resource is shown there), and each
  test gets its own page at `/student/resources/day-2/[category]` — `tat`, `wat`, `srt`, `sd-sdt`,
  `full-day` — showing only that test's resources. Invalid slugs 404 via `notFound()`.
- lib/day2/categories.ts (new): single source of truth for category labels, full names, one-line and
  beginner-explanation copy, the URL-slug↔`Day2TestCategory` mapping, and the category icon map — used
  by every Day 2 component instead of five separate ad-hoc `CATEGORY_LABELS` objects.
- components/student/day2/day2-visual.tsx (new): five small abstract line-art SVG compositions (one
  per category — a frame+story-line for TAT, stacked word-bars for WAT, a branching path for SRT,
  mirrored ellipses for SD/SDT, a connected-dot sequence for Full Day 2), built only from the existing
  ink/accent tokens — not stock imagery, not a reproduction of any copyrighted test material.
- components/student/day2/day2-hero.tsx (rewritten): lighter overview hero — title, "Understand ·
  Practice · Perform", a short plain-language paragraph, a real resource count. The detailed TAT/WAT/
  SRT/SD/Full Day 2 flow moved out into its own section (below) so the hero doesn't repeat it.
- components/student/day2/day2-journey.tsx (new): the TAT → WAT → SRT → SD/SDT → Full Day 2 flow —
  each node is icon + short name + full name + one-liner, linking straight to that category's page; a
  "+" connector (not an arrow) before Full Day 2 to signal "combination", not "sequence".
- components/student/day2/day2-beginner-path.tsx (new): the "New to Day 2?" 5-step guide (Learn → See
  Examples → Practice → Go Timed → Get Feedback) — informational now, not a filter control, since
  filtering moved to each category page; horizontal with arrows on desktop, vertical with down-arrows
  on mobile; ends in a CTA anchored to the category grid.
- components/student/day2/day2-category-grid.tsx (new): the 5-card "Explore the Day 2 Tests" grid on
  the overview page — visual + short/full name + explanation + a real, per-category resource count
  (computed from the live dataset) + "Explore Resources →", linking to that category's page.
- components/student/day2/day2-category-hero.tsx (new): per-category page header — breadcrumb
  (Resources / Day 2 / <test>), an explicit "← Back to Day 2" link, visual, title, one-paragraph "what
  is this test" explanation, and the real resource count for that category.
- components/student/day2/day2-category-explorer.tsx (new, replaces the deleted
  day2-resource-explorer.tsx): scoped to one category's resources only. Surfaces that category's
  curated `featured` resource as "Recommended starting point", groups the rest into Study
  Guides/Examples/Practice/Videos/Feedback by the existing `purpose`/`resourceType` fields (a group
  only renders if it actually has resources — SD/SDT has no Examples/Videos group, and that's shown
  honestly rather than padded), with its own search and group-filter chips.
- components/student/day2/day2-resource-card.tsx (redesigned): dropped the category badge (redundant —
  the page you're on already tells you the category), dropped the raw verification-status sentence and
  the separate login-required tag from the card face (kept as an underlying data field / folded into
  the "Verified"/"Needs verification" tag). Card is now: type icon + eyebrow, title, a 2-line-clamped
  description, one compact "Access · Platform · Purpose" metadata line, one CTA button. No resource
  data, URL, name, category, access, timing or verification value was changed — only what's printed on
  the card face.
- Deleted components/student/day2/day2-resource-explorer.tsx and its test file (superseded by the
  category explorer above) — confirmed nothing else referenced either file before removing.
- tests/unit/components/day2-category-explorer.test.tsx (new, replaces the deleted explorer test):
  featured/"Recommended starting point", group rendering (incl. a thin-category case with SD/SDT
  proving empty groups don't render), search + empty state, group-filter chip, and real-URL/new-tab
  link safety — all against the real curated dataset via `getDay2ResourcesByCategory`.
- No changes to lib/mock/day2-resources.ts, lib/api/day2-resources.ts or types/day2-resources.ts — the
  curated dataset, its URLs, names, categories, access info and verification status are untouched.
- Verified clean: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint .`, `npx vitest run` (38 passed, 5 pre-existing todo),
  `npm run build` (all 6 Day 2 routes compile, including the new `/student/resources/day-2/[category]`
  dynamic segment).
- A real `.env.local` (Supabase project credentials) is now present in this environment (it wasn't
  earlier in the day) — confirmed via a local dev server that every `/student/resources/day-2*` route
  correctly 307-redirects to `/login` when unauthenticated, i.e. the real auth guard covers the new
  routes exactly like the rest of `/student/*`, including invalid category slugs (which redirect to
  login rather than leaking a 404 to an anonymous caller).

What remains:
- No Chrome browser automation was available this session (declined during setup), so the redesigned
  pages were not visually click-tested as an authenticated user — only build/lint/type/unit-test
  verified, plus the anonymous-redirect check above. A real logged-in walkthrough (navigation between
  pages, filters, external CTA buttons, mobile layout, console errors) is still needed before sign-off.
- Detail pages (`/student/resources/day-2/[category]/[slug]`) were deliberately not built — every
  curated resource is an external site/video/app with no useful additional EliteCadet-side context to
  show, so the card's CTA opens it directly, per the brief's own "don't create detail pages
  unnecessarily" instruction.

Blocker:
- None in the code. Only the lack of an in-session browser blocks the visual walkthrough.

Next task:
- A logged-in manual (or Chrome-automation) pass through all 6 routes once the user has reviewed this
  round of changes.

Task: T037a — Day 2 Resources, round 2: information-architecture + visual redesign
Status: Done

What changed:
- User visually inspected round 1 (previous entry above) and rejected it as "a database/resource dump
  rendered onto a page" — too much text on every card, verification/pricing badges dominating the
  visual hierarchy, all of a category's resources shown at once instead of true progressive
  disclosure. This entry is a full IA + visual overhaul, not a decoration pass, per the user's explicit
  brief (pasted in full in the requesting message).
- New third navigation level: a category page (`/student/resources/day-2/[category]`) no longer dumps
  every resource. It now shows "What do you want to do?" — a picker of only the sections that actually
  have a matching resource (Learn Basics/Examples/Practice/Videos/Feedback) — and only after the
  student picks one does `/student/resources/day-2/[category]?do=<section>` render that section's
  resources. Section choice is a real URL (`?do=`), so back/forward and deep-linking both work.
  New: `lib/day2/sections.ts` (single source of truth for the five sections + which resources match
  each, replacing the group logic that used to live inline in the old category explorer),
  `components/student/day2/day2-section-picker.tsx`, `components/student/day2/day2-resource-list.tsx`
  (search now scoped to one section, not the whole category).
- New generic flip card (`components/student/day2/day2-flip-card.tsx`), used for both the five Day 2
  test cards and every category's section cards — same fixed dimensions, same structure everywhere.
  Front: image/visual band + title + tiny subtitle + count + "Explore". Back (hover on desktop via
  plain CSS `:hover`; a dedicated "i" info-toggle button, independent of hover, for keyboard/touch):
  "What is X?" + one-sentence explanation + CTA. Flip mechanics in `app/globals.css`
  (`.day2-flip-card`/`.day2-flip-inner`/`.day2-flip-face*`), reduced-motion already covered by the
  existing global `prefers-reduced-motion` rule (transition duration zeroed for everyone).
- Five per-category accent colours introduced (`--day2-tat/wat/srt/sdt/full`, `DAY2_CATEGORY_ACCENT` in
  `lib/day2/categories.ts`) — a deliberate, scoped exception to `AGENTS.md` §7.1, recorded in the
  Decisions Register above. Applied only as a thin card-top line, icon tint, faint wash, hover border
  and that test's CTA (`.day2-cat-line`/`.day2-cat-icon`/`.day2-cat-wash`/`.day2-cat-hover` in
  `app/globals.css`) — never a full-card fill.
- `components/student/day2/day2-visual.tsx`: category marks now use `currentColor` for their primary
  strokes (previously hardcoded to `--brand-accent`) so the same five SVGs pick up each test's accent
  wherever they're placed, plus a `bare` variant for use inside a surface that already frames it (the
  flip card's visual band).
- `components/student/day2/day2-illustration.tsx` (new): the overview hero's one illustration — a
  notebook with a dotted ascent line to a summit marker, same line-art language as the category marks.
- `components/student/day2/day2-hero.tsx` (rewritten): shorter copy (title, three-word subtitle, one
  sentence), the new illustration, and a primary "Quick Start" CTA (Feature 3 below).
- `components/student/day2/day2-journey.tsx` (rewritten): shorter per-node text (`microLabel`, e.g.
  "Picture Stories" — new field on `DAY2_CATEGORY_META`), a connecting gradient line behind the nodes,
  each icon tinted with that test's accent.
- `components/student/day2/day2-beginner-path.tsx` (rewritten): the old 5-step numbered guide replaced
  with a single slim "Recommended for beginners" row (Learn → Examples → Practice) — Feature 1 from the
  brief's "up to 3 small premium features" — so the overview page stays short.
- `components/student/day2/day2-fullday-banner.tsx` (new): Full Day 2's own special treatment (brief
  §17) — the TAT→WAT→SRT→SD/SDT→Personal Interview chain and one "Start Full Day 2" CTA straight into
  its Practice section, shown above the normal section picker only on that one category page.
- `components/student/day2/day2-resource-card.tsx` (redesigned): dropped the "Verified"/"Needs
  verification" `StatusTag` and the Free/Freemium/Paid access badge from the card face entirely (brief
  §14–16 — that research/curation metadata still lives in `lib/mock/day2-resources.ts`, it's just not
  printed on the card). Card now shows: icon, a tiny purpose label (PRACTICE/LEARN/…), title, one
  clamped sentence, and a CTA — nothing else. The AI-feedback-confidence note (a genuine AGENTS.md §11
  safety disclosure, not research metadata) stays, shrunk to one line with the full statement in a
  native tooltip.
- `lib/day2/recently-viewed.ts` + `components/student/day2/day2-recently-viewed.tsx` (new) — Feature 2
  from the brief: a per-browser "recently viewed" strip on the overview page, backed by `localStorage`
  only (never sent to the server, never blocks navigation if storage is unavailable). Recorded on a
  resource card's CTA click.
- No changes to `lib/mock/day2-resources.ts`, `lib/api/day2-resources.ts` or `types/day2-resources.ts`
  — the curated dataset (URLs, names, categories, access info, verification status) is untouched, only
  which fields the UI prints changed, per the brief's own "DATA ≠ UI" rule.
- Deleted `components/student/day2/day2-category-explorer.tsx` and its test (split into
  `day2-section-picker.tsx` + `day2-resource-list.tsx` above); replaced its test with
  `tests/unit/components/day2-section-picker.test.tsx` (non-empty-only sections, thin-category case,
  links carry a `?do=` query) and `tests/unit/components/day2-resource-list.test.tsx` (section-scoped
  results, back link, search + empty state, no verification/pricing text on a card, real-URL/new-tab
  link safety).
- **Two real bugs found only by actually running the app in a browser** (not caught by `tsc`, ESLint,
  or Vitest) and fixed before sign-off:
  1. `[category]/page.tsx` (a Server Component) was passing the full section object — including its
     Lucide icon component reference and its `match` function — as a prop into the client
     `Day2ResourceList`, the exact Server→Client serialization violation `AGENTS.md` §7.12 warns about,
     just in the section hand-off rather than a nav icon. Threw at runtime ("Functions cannot be passed
     directly to Client Components…"). Fixed by passing only the section's `key` (a string) and having
     `Day2ResourceList` resolve the icon locally from `DAY2_SECTIONS`, matching the existing
     `lib/day2/categories.ts` pattern.
  2. `Day2RecentlyViewed` initially read `localStorage` via a `useState(() => …)` lazy initializer (the
     same pattern already used by `ResourceReadBadge`) — for a returning visitor with existing entries,
     this produces a real hydration mismatch (server necessarily renders nothing; client renders the
     strip), confirmed via a browser `pageerror` event. Fixed with `useSyncExternalStore`, whose
     `getServerSnapshot` always returns the same empty array so the initial client render matches the
     server exactly, with the real snapshot taking over immediately after hydration.
- Verified in a real, signed-up browser session (Playwright + system Chrome, no dev-only auth bypass):
  full `Day 2 → TAT → Practice → resource` and `Day 2 → Full Day 2 → Start Full Day 2 → Practice` flows,
  the SD/SDT thin-category case (only Learn Basics + Practice offered, matching its actual resource
  mix), section-scoped search + empty state, the "Recommended starting point" callout, hover-flip and
  its independent keyboard path (`Tab` to the info button, `Enter` toggles `aria-expanded`), the mobile
  tap-flip equivalent, the Recently Viewed strip appearing after opening a resource, and zero horizontal
  overflow at 1440/768/390px across all three hierarchy levels. Also `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint`
  (targeted paths), `npx vitest run` (45 passed, 5 pre-existing todo), `npm run build` (all Day 2 routes
  compile).

What remains:
- Nothing known-broken. The pre-existing technical debt entries above (mock backend data, per-academy
  isolation) are unrelated to this feature.



Date: 2026-09-21
Task: T039 follow-up — content depth + a "Continue where you left off" card
Status: Complete (verified — build/lint/type-check clean; Playwright walkthrough against a production
build covering the overview, a Day 1 practice module, Day 3's info cards, the self-assessment, and
the final progress page, zero console/page errors)

What changed:
- User feedback after reviewing T039: "make it more informative, take reference from Target SSB" plus
  a dev-mode load-time complaint. Load time was confirmed to be Turbopack's per-route first-compile
  cost in dev mode only (not a real bug — the production build already loads pages in ~100-200ms, per
  T039's own verification); switched the local server to production mode for review per user's choice.
- `SsbDaySummary.longDescription`: a 2-3 sentence paragraph per day (what actually happens, why it
  matters), rendered under the existing one-line description on each `[day]/page.tsx`.
- `SsbModuleDetail.context`: a short "why this matters" line for bank/checklist/summary modules
  (OIR/PPDT/WAT/TAT/SRT-practice, Personal Interview, Conference Questions, Final Self Assessment,
  Final Progress) — the equivalent of reading/info's existing `overview` for module kinds that
  otherwise jumped straight into the interactive UI with no context. Threaded through
  `BankPracticeRunner`/`SsbBankTestSession` as a new optional prop, rendered once above the item
  content.
- `SsbInfoContent.durationLabel` (e.g. "~10-15 min · Group of 8-10, no leader"): added to all 9 Day
  3/4 info-only modules (GD, Group Planning, PGT, HGT, Race, Lecturette, Individual Obstacles, Command
  Task, FGT) plus Mock Conference — shown on the day grid card and the module's own page. Card
  one-line descriptions for these same modules were also expanded to be more descriptive than a bare
  task name.
- `components/practice/continue-journey-card.tsx` (new): a "Continue where you left off" card on the
  Practice overview, visually mirroring the dashboard's existing "Today's Mission" card
  (`app/student/page.tsx`) rather than inventing a new style. Points at the first practice-mode bank
  module with incomplete progress (day/module order via a new `getContinueCandidates()` in
  `lib/api/ssb-journey.ts`), defaulting to the very first module (Day 1 OIR Practice) for a
  fresh/no-progress account, or a "every practice bank is done" state if all are complete. Follows the
  same SSR-safe-default-then-useEffect pattern as the rest of T039's progress components to avoid a
  hydration mismatch.

What remains:
- Same Technical Debt as T039 itself (mock content scale, localStorage-only progress, no mentor/
  academy visibility, AI feedback blocked on B3) — this was a content/informativeness pass, not a
  architecture change.
- Day/module grid cards are still hand-built rather than the shared `StatCard` component (unchanged
  from T039).

Blocker:
- None. B3 and the backend migration remain open and unrelated.

Next task:
- User to review the production-mode server in their own browser.

Task: Auth-callback fix + dev-preview restore (not tracked against a task.md ID — small fixes to
already-`[x]` T013/T014)
Status: Complete (verified — build/lint/type-check clean)

What changed:
- app/auth/callback/route.ts: now handles Supabase's token_hash+type email-link format (mentor
  invites, password resets) in addition to the PKCE code format it already handled. Fixes bug S49
  ("email authentication links not displaying properly, mentor login option missing").
- lib/actions/academy.ts, lib/api/auth.ts: redirectTo now points at the final destination directly,
  to match the token_hash email template variable.
- app/dev-preview/[role]/route.ts, lib/auth/dev-preview.ts, app/(public)/page.tsx: landing-page role
  "Preview" links restored as a dev-only real-auth sign-in (seeded demo account per role), gated on
  NODE_ENV !== "production". Not a bypass — creates a real session, so every downstream authorization
  check still runs.

What remains:
- Same as T013/T014's existing Technical Debt row — unrelated to this fix.


Blocker:
- None.

Next task:


- User review of this round; then, per the standing instruction for this task, no commit/push until
  they've inspected it.

Date: 2026-09-23
Task: T037a — Day 2 Resources, round 3: visual/text refinement
Status: Done

What changed:
- User visually inspected round 2 and, while confirming the IA/UX direction was much better, asked for
  a further pass: aggressively less text everywhere, a genuinely new second-level taxonomy, slower/
  calmer animation, and — in their own words — more visual personality because the marks still read as
  "terrible and too boring." This is a refinement of round 2, not a re-architecture.
- **Text removed, by location:**
  - `/student/resources` Day 2 entry card: dropped its two-line description entirely — now icon +
    "Day 2" + "Explore Day 2 →", nothing else.
  - Day 2 overview hero: dropped the one-sentence description and the "57 curated resources…" line;
    "Understand. Practice. Improve." became "Understand → Practice → Improve" per the user's literal
    suggested hierarchy. `Day2Hero` no longer takes a `resourceCount` prop.
  - Day 2 overview footer: removed the closing "Not sure where to start? Start with TAT." paragraph —
    pure redundancy with the hero's own Quick Start button, which already goes to the same place.
  - Category hero (`Day2CategoryHero`): removed the full explanation paragraph and the resource-count
    line entirely — it's now just the visual + short label (e.g. "TAT") + a one-line full-name caption.
    The explanation still exists, just one level up, on the test card's flip-back. `Day2CategoryHero`
    no longer takes a `resourceCount` prop.
  - "Choose a Test" and "What do you want to do?" headings lost their subtitle lines (the heading
    already says what to do; the subtitle repeated it).
  - Full Day 2 banner: dropped the redundant "TAT → WAT → SRT → SD/SDT, back-to-back" sentence — the
    chain visual directly below it already shows exactly that.
  - "New to Day 2?" row: dropped its subtitle line, kept only the eyebrow + pills.
- **New second-level taxonomy** (`lib/day2/sections.ts`, fully rewritten): the previous
  Learn/Examples/Practice/Videos/Feedback split is now **Learn Basics / Practice / Tests / Videos /
  Articles / Feedback**, matching the user's explicit structure. "Examples" is gone as a section —
  verified against the real dataset that every resource tagged `purpose: "example"` also carries
  `learn`, `practice`, or `test-series`/`full-mock`, so nothing became unreachable; "Tests" now covers
  `resourceType: "test"` plus `test-series`/`full-mock` purposes, "Articles" covers
  `resourceType: "article"`. Recomputed real per-category counts confirm the new taxonomy stays
  non-empty and meaningful: TAT/SRT/full-day-2 get all 6 sections, WAT gets 5 (no Feedback), SD/SDT
  stays honestly thin at 3 (Learn Basics/Practice/Articles only — no Tests, Videos or Feedback,
  confirmed there's real data behind exactly those three and nothing invented for the rest).
- **Visual personality** (the "boring" complaint): replaced all five `Day2Visual` category marks
  (`components/student/day2/day2-visual.tsx`) with fuller illustrated scenes in the same line-art
  language rather than sparse geometric sketches — TAT gained a small landscape inside its picture
  frame, WAT gained a pen mid-stroke over its notebook, SRT gained a flag marking the chosen fork, SDT
  became an explicit silhouette-and-mirrored-reflection composition across a dashed axis, Full Day 2
  gained a finish-line flag at its last checkpoint. `.day2-cat-wash` (`app/globals.css`) changed from a
  flat 7% tint to a two-stop diagonal gradient (14%→4%) for more depth. The hero illustration's summit
  flag now has a slow (3.6s), ≤2px float (`.day2-illus-float`, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion` via
  the existing global rule).
- **Animation slowed and made more premium**, entirely scoped to Day 2's own CSS (`.day2-rise-in`
  entrance, `.day2-flip-*`, both already isolated from the rest of the app):
  `--motion-duration-entrance` 420ms → 520ms, `--motion-duration-flip` 480ms → 650ms, stagger
  increments 60ms → 90–100ms, and a new `--motion-easing-premium`
  (`cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`) used for the flip transform instead of the standard, snappier
  `--motion-easing`. Flip cards also gained a small hover lift + shadow on the outer card (independent
  of the flip transform on the inner rotator, so the two don't fight) and the front visual now zooms
  ~1.08× on hover — the "reveal the accent, don't jump" interaction the brief asked for.
- Resource cards (`Day2ResourceCard`) gained `glass-hover-lift` alongside their existing accent-border
  hover, so they now lift + gain a stronger shadow on hover like the rest of the product's card pattern,
  not just a border tint.
- No changes to `lib/mock/day2-resources.ts`, `lib/api/day2-resources.ts` or `types/day2-resources.ts`,
  and no change to Supabase auth — confirmed both per the user's explicit constraints for this round.
- Updated `tests/unit/components/day2-section-picker.test.tsx` for the new taxonomy: TAT now asserts
  all six section labels present; the thin-category case now asserts SD/SDT shows Learn Basics/Practice/
  Articles and not Tests/Videos/Feedback (previously asserted against "Examples"/"Videos").
  `day2-resource-list.test.tsx` needed no changes — the "learn"/"practice" section keys it exercises
  were unchanged by the taxonomy rewrite.
- Verified in a real, signed-up browser session (Playwright + system Chrome, no auth bypass), across
  three separate accounts created this round: the trimmed Resources → Day 2 gateway, the trimmed
  overview hero/journey/beginner-row, all five flip cards' hover-flip after the slower transition
  settles, the TAT category page showing all six new sections, the SD/SDT thin-category case exactly as
  predicted from the real data, the WAT category page following the identical structure, the Full Day 2
  banner, and the two brand-new section types (Tests, Articles) rendering real, correctly-filtered
  resources for TAT. Zero console errors/warnings across the whole walkthrough. Confirmed zero
  horizontal overflow at 390px again after the layout changes. Also `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint`
  (targeted paths), `npx vitest run` (40 passed, 5 pre-existing todo), `npm run build` (all Day 2 routes
  compile).

What remains:
- Nothing known-broken.



- Merge with origin/main (this session) to pick up the T039 follow-up work built in parallel.
```

```text
Date: 2026-09-22
Task: Sync local main with origin/main
Status: Complete (verified)

What changed:
- git merge origin/main into local main: pulled in PR #2 (T039 content-depth follow-up, already
  logged above under 2026-09-21) alongside the two local-only commits logged directly above. No file
  overlap, clean merge, zero conflicts.
- npm install + npm run build verified clean post-merge (all 35 routes compile).
- This file (status.md) and task.md reviewed and reconciled against the merged code — see the two
  entries directly above, which were committed locally but never logged here or in task.md.

What remains:
- Two local commits from this merge (auth-callback fix, dev-preview restore) are not yet pushed to
  origin/main.




Blocker:
- None.

Next task:


- User review of this round; per the standing instruction for this task, no commit/push until they've
  inspected it.



- Push local main to origin so origin/main has the auth-callback fix and dev-preview restore too.
- Then resolve B3 (AI provider) — still the only remaining MVP feature gap.

Task: T066 — test layer audit, missing tests, CI
Status: Partial (verified locally — 84/84 Vitest, 9/9 Playwright, lint and typecheck clean; CI not
yet run on GitHub)

What changed:
- Audit: unit (`tests/unit`) and e2e (`tests/e2e`) layers existed; there was no integration layer and
  no CI. Several client helpers and the logged-in half of the role guard had no tests at all.
- New unit tests: journey progress store, resource read state, `useCountdown`.
- New `tests/integration/`: `updateSession()` middleware with a faked Supabase client (wrong role /
  missing profile → `/forbidden`), practice and 5-Day Journey API clients against their real
  content, and `BankPracticeRunner` wired to the real progress store. New `test:unit` /
  `test:integration` / `typecheck` scripts.
- e2e: 6 of 9 specs timed out locally. Cause: parallel workers starving the dev server's per-route
  compile; the middleware itself was correct (`/student` → 307 to `/login` in 0.02s via curl). Fixed
  by using one local worker; CI serves the production build instead.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint, typecheck, unit, integration, then build + e2e.

What remains:
- Push the branch, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` repo secrets,
  confirm the first CI run, and require the checks on `main` via branch protection.
- Logged-in e2e flows (student journey, wrong-role redirect in a real browser) still need seeded
  test accounts.

Blocker:
- None for this task. AI feedback tests remain blocked on B3.

Next task:
- Push and verify CI; then decide on seeded e2e accounts.

Date: 2026-09-24
Task: T073 — Academy shell + dashboard redesign
Status: Complete — awaiting user review (UNVERIFIED only for logged-in flow, see below)

What changed:
- New reusable Academy shell: `components/academy/layout/` (AcademyLayout, AcademyBrand, AcademyNavigation, AcademySidebarFooter, AcademyHeader, AcademyMobileNav); nav is config-driven (`lib/academy/navigation.ts`, unbuilt sections render disabled with a "Soon" tag). Desktop sidebar → icon rail on tablet → drawer on mobile
- Shared Academy components: `components/academy/shared/` (MetricCard, SectionHeader, StatusBadge, ProgressBar, ChartCard, DataTable, ActivityItem, QuickAction); EmptyState/LoadingState/ErrorState reused from `components/ui`
- Dashboard (`components/academy/dashboard/`) rebuilt over the existing data via `lib/academy/dashboard-view.ts`; Recharts added for the batch-readiness bar chart; `app/academy/loading.tsx` added
- Scoped `.academy-app` tokens in `app/globals.css`; 7 icon keys added to `components/ui/nav-icons.tsx`
- Verified: typecheck, eslint, 78 unit tests, `next build`; rendered in headless Chromium at 1440/820/390 px and 1440x640 — no horizontal overflow, no console errors, mobile drawer opens

What remains:
- Logged-in verification: `/dev-preview/academy_admin` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (not in `.env.local`), so the real `/academy` route was not exercised end to end; rendering was checked through a temporary harness route that was then deleted
- Existing Academy sub-pages (students, batches, mentors, reports, settings) pick up the new shell and white-card materials but were not visually reviewed
- Trend/radar/sessions widgets need data-contract approval first

Blocker:
- None

Next task:
- User review of the dashboard; no further Academy feature until approved

Date: 2026-10-03
Task: T073 — Academy dashboard rebuilt to match the reference layout
Status: Complete — awaiting user review

What changed:
- Layout now follows the reference: greeting + hero banner, 5 KPI cards, [performance line chart | assessment radar | today's tasks], [recent activity | batch performance | upcoming sessions], 5 quick actions
- Bar chart replaced by `StudentPerformanceChart` (Recharts line chart, 3 series with distinct dash patterns, 3/6-month range) and `AssessmentRadar` (academy average vs benchmark)
- New typed contract `AcademyAnalytics` (types/academy.ts) + `getAnalytics()` (lib/api/academy.ts), demo-backed by `lib/mock/academy-analytics.ts`; panels show "Demo data" while `source === "demo"`
- Today's Tasks now also derives "Sessions this week" and "Low performance alert" (<60% readiness) from existing data
- New shared pieces: IconTile, DemoBadge; ChartCard/SectionHeader gained `headerExtra`/`badge` slots

What remains:
- Backend tables for real analytics: monthly assessment scores by test type, per-skill rubric averages + benchmark, a sessions schedule
- Logged-in verification (still needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for `/dev-preview`)

Blocker:
- None for the UI; real analytics blocked on the data model above

Next task:
- User review; no further Academy feature until approved

Date: 2026-10-04
Task: T074 — Academy Students management page
Status: Complete — awaiting user review

What changed:
- `/academy/students` rebuilt: KPI row (also quick filters), search + status/batch/mentor/performance filters + sort, responsive table (cards on phones), paginated (20/page), row actions menu, Add Student dialog with validation + toast
- Filtering is server-side and URL-driven (`?q=&status=&batch=&mentor=&performance=&sort=&page=`) via the pure `lib/academy/student-list.ts` (parse → join → filter → sort → paginate); the same params become WHERE/ORDER BY/range when students move to Postgres
- Row actions limited to what the backend supports: view, change batch (mentor follows batch), mark active/inactive. "Edit student" and "Assign mentor" deliberately not shown (no update-name action; mentor is derived from the batch)
- Removed the old inline `add-student-form.tsx` (replaced by the dialog)
- Tests: `tests/unit/lib/academy-student-list.test.ts` (10 tests); typecheck, lint, 90 unit tests pass; browser-verified search, combined filters, clear, add (validation, duplicate, success), change batch, mark inactive, empty and no-results states, no overflow at 390/820/1100/1440

What remains:
- Students are NOT in Supabase (schema has only `academies` and `profiles`); data is the in-memory layer in `lib/mock/academy.ts`. A `students` table (+ email/created_at) is needed for real persistence, "Recently added" (currently insertion order) and Add-by-email
- Logged-in verification of the real `/academy/students` route (needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for `/dev-preview`); verified through a temporary harness page, since deleted

Blocker:
- None for the UI

Next task:
- User review; Batches MVP blocked on a data-model decision (see Decisions Register)

Date: 2026-10-04
Task: T075 — Academy Batches management (Supabase-backed)
Status: Complete in code and tests — NOT yet run against a live database (migration must be applied first)

What changed:
- Migration `supabase/migrations/0003_batches.sql` (see Decisions Register)
- `/academy/batches` rebuilt: summary cards (total / active / without mentor, from COUNT queries), search + mentor + status filters + sort, server-side pagination (20/page, range queries), responsive table → cards, row menu (edit, assign/change mentor, archive/restore with confirmation), Create Batch dialog (name, mentor, start date), loading skeleton, empty / no-results / error (with retry and "run the migration" guidance) states
- Data layer: `lib/api/batches.ts` (reads, boundary-validated rows), `lib/actions/batches.ts` (create/update/mentor/status; admin check + server validation + RLS; success only after Postgres confirms), pure helpers `lib/academy/batch-validation.ts` and `batch-list.ts`
- New shared pieces: `useUrlFilters` hook, SearchField, FilterSelect, Pagination, RetryErrorState (Students keeps its own copies; it can adopt these later)
- Removed the old inline `create-batch-form.tsx`
- Tests: 26 new unit tests (validation, URL params, and the server actions/queries against a mocked Supabase client asserting the exact filters, scoping and writes); UI verified in a browser through a temporary harness (no real session)

What remains:
- Apply 0003 in the Supabase SQL Editor, then test end to end as a real academy admin (see checklist in the hand-off)
- Student counts per batch and student-based summary cards need a `students` table with `batch_id`
- Batch detail page, delete (deliberately omitted), Students/Dashboard still on in-memory batches

Blocker:
- Needs the migration applied and a signed-in academy admin to verify against live data

Next task:
- User review

Date: 2026-10-07
Task: T080 — Admin access foundation (content administration, Phase 8)
Status: Complete in code and tests. NOT yet run against a live database (migration must be applied first)

What changed:
- Migration `supabase/migrations/0004_admin_access.sql` (see Decisions Register)
- Pure rules in `lib/admin/access.ts`: route → requirement map anchored on `/admin` (unmapped `/admin/*` paths require `super`), `canAccess`, `parseGrantInput`
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`: `/admin` paths are gated by `admin_grants` (not `profiles.role`); signed out → `/login`, no grant → `/forbidden`; existing role routes are unchanged
- `lib/auth/admin.ts` (`getAdminGrants`, `requireAdminArea`) re-checks on the server in the layout, every page and both actions
- `lib/api/admin-access.ts` (grant list via RPC, boundary-validated) and `lib/actions/admin-access.ts` (grant by email, revoke; super-only, server validation, RLS as the final gate, anti-lockout)
- UI: `/admin` (overview of the areas you can open), `/admin/access` (grant form, who-has-access list, remove), guarded placeholder pages for `/admin/{student,mentor,academy}-content`; nav shows only permitted areas
- Tests: `tests/unit/lib/admin-access.test.ts`, `admin-access-actions.test.ts`, `admin-auth-guard.test.ts`, `admin-access-api.test.ts`, seven `/admin` cases in `tests/integration/middleware-session.test.ts`, and `/admin` + `/admin/access` added to the e2e auth-guard list (e2e not run locally: needs a reachable Supabase project)
- Reviewed before PR by a multi-agent review (SQL security, app security, correctness, design/a11y, tests/governance; each finding checked by three skeptics). Fixes applied: revoke uses the shared Dialog instead of `window.confirm`; 44px touch targets; grant/revoke recover from a thrown action instead of sticking in "loading"; outcome announced in a live region with focus moved to the list heading; area shown as a neutral tag, not a status colour; retryable error state and a `loading.tsx` for `/admin/access`; two font weights per screen; the header "Profile" link goes to the person's own role profile; `/forbidden` copy no longer blames the role. Refuted findings (e.g. case-variant UUID self-revoke, already stopped by the RLS delete policy) were not changed
- `app/globals.css`: new `.row-action` modifier (destructive icon button: danger only on hover, shared accent focus ring), per AGENTS.md §7.12
- `app/forbidden/page.tsx`: copy changed from role-specific to permission-generic, since `/admin` denials are about grants, not role
- Verified: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` clean; all Vitest suites pass under Node 22 semantics (see note)
- Note: locally on Node 25, 40 pre-existing tests in 6 files fail with `window.localStorage.clear is not a function` (Node 25's built-in Web Storage shadows jsdom's). They fail identically on `main` and all pass with `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage`; CI pins Node 22 and is unaffected. Tracked as a separate fix, not part of this change

What remains:
- Apply 0004 in the Supabase SQL Editor and bootstrap the first super admin (SQL in the migration header)
- Live check: super admin grants an area to a second account → that account sees only that area → access removed → the next request is forbidden
- T081 / T083 content editors; T082 needs its spec first

Blocker:
- Needs the migration applied and two signed-in accounts to verify against live data

Next task:
- User review, then T081 on `feat/admin-student-content` (rebased onto this once merged)
