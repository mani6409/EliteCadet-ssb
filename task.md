# task.md — SSB Academy Web Platform Implementation Roadmap

**Type:** Single authoritative implementation roadmap.
**Authority:** Sequencing and acceptance. Requirements live in `specs.md`; rules live in `AGENTS.md`.
**Last structural revision:** 2026-09-16

---

## How to use this file

Every task carries: **ID · Priority · Status · Why · Depends on · Requirements · Acceptance · Tests**.

### Status legend

```text
[ ]  NOT STARTED
[-]  IN PROGRESS
[x]  COMPLETE (verified — implementation inspected, acceptance criteria met)
[~]  BLOCKED (dependency or decision missing)
[!]  NEEDS DECISION
```

### Priority legend

```text
P0  Required for MVP; blocks the core loop
P1  Required for MVP completeness, not for the first working loop
P2  Post-MVP
```

### Rules

- A task is never marked `[x]` on the strength of a rendering UI. Verify behaviour.
- Never start a `[~]` task by guessing the blocked decision — resolve it in `status.md` first.
- Update `status.md` in the same commit that changes a task's status.
- New work becomes a task here before it is written. No untracked side changes.

### Current state of the roadmap

T001–T005 (Foundation), T010/T011 (public site), T020–T038 except T034/T035 (full Student experience,
including T037a Day 2 Resources), T021/T040–T045 (full Mentor experience) and T022/T050–T055 (full
Academy experience) are complete on mock data — see `status.md` for the verified snapshot. T012
(Pricing) skipped as P1. T013/T014 (real Supabase authentication + role-based access) are now also
complete as of 2026-09-19 — see `status.md` §11. T039 (5-Day SSB Practice Journey, previously deferred)
complete as of 2026-09-20. Remaining: T034/T035 (AI feedback, blocked on B3), and Phase 6 quality/security
audits, which still need to account for the mock-data gap documented in status.md → Technical Debt.
Phase 8 (Content Administration, T080–T083) was added 2026-10-07. T080, the shared access
foundation, comes first.

# Phase 0 — Foundation

## T001 — Repository inspection & reconciliation — P0 — `[x]`

**Why:** Every other task assumes a known starting point. This roadmap currently assumes nothing
exists; that assumption must be replaced with fact.

**Depends on:** repository access.

**Requirements**
- Inspect structure, routing, existing components, hooks, API layer, types.
- Record installed versions: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Lucide.
- Record environment variables present and required.
- Record lint/build configuration and whether both pass.
- Identify reusable components, partial implementations, TODOs and dead code.
- Update `status.md` §Architecture and §Implementation with `VERIFIED` / `PARTIAL` / `BROKEN` marks.
- Re-mark any task below that is already implemented.

**Acceptance:** `status.md` contains no `UNVERIFIED` entry for anything that exists in the repository,
and no task here contradicts the code.

**Tests:** n/a (audit task). `npm run lint` and a production build must be attempted and their real
result recorded.

---

## T002 — Development standards — P0 — `[x]`

**Why:** Conventions decided after code exists are conventions that get violated.

**Depends on:** T001.

**Requirements:** confirm ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind config, shadcn/ui setup,
Lucide; agree file/folder naming; document deviations in `AGENTS.md` §5.

**Acceptance:** project installs, lints, type-checks and builds from a clean checkout with documented
commands.

**Tests:** CI-equivalent command sequence runs clean locally.

---

## T003 — Design token layer (Glass Capsule) — P0 — `[x]`

**Why:** The design system in `AGENTS.md` §7 is mandatory and token-driven. Building screens before
tokens guarantees scattered literals and an inconsistent UI.

**Depends on:** T002.

**Requirements**
- Implement every token listed in `AGENTS.md` §7.10 in the Tailwind/CSS layer.
- Navy brand scale, light background scale, muted text, glass opacity, blur, border opacity, two
  shadow levels, capsule radii, spacing scale, motion duration and easing.
- Provide a `prefers-reduced-motion` override that disables transform and opacity animation.
- No component may use a raw colour, radius, blur or duration literal after this task.

**Acceptance:** a token change (e.g. navy hue, capsule radius) propagates across the app without
editing any component.

**Tests:** lint rule or review checklist that flags raw hex values and arbitrary radii in components.

---

## T004 — Capsule primitive components — P0 — `[x]`

**Why:** The whole UI is built from three capsule levels. They must exist once, not per page.

**Depends on:** T003.

**Requirements**
- `CapsulePrimary`, `CapsuleSecondary`, `CapsuleSmall` — icon + label + optional description.
- All eight states: default, hover, pressed, selected, disabled, loading, success, error.
- Hover: `translateY(-1px…-3px)`, scale ≈ 1.01–1.02, slightly stronger shadow. Press: slight
  scale-down with smooth recovery. No spring, no bounce.
- Keyboard focusable with a visible focus ring; correct semantics (button vs link).
- Responsive sizing per `AGENTS.md` §7.9, including horizontal-scroll behaviour for small capsules.

**Acceptance:** all three levels render correctly at 320px, 768px, 1280px and 1920px; every state is
reachable by keyboard; reduced-motion disables animation; contrast passes with the glass applied.

**Tests:** interaction state test for one capsule level; axe/keyboard pass on a capsule group.

---

## T005 — Base UI system — P0 — `[x]`

**Why:** Non-capsule surfaces (forms, tables, dialogs) still need consistency.

**Depends on:** T003.

**Requirements:** typography scale, spacing usage, buttons, inputs, selects, dialogs, tabs, badges,
tables, alerts, and shared loading / empty / error state components.

**Acceptance:** all three role experiences consume the same primitives; no page defines its own
button, badge or empty state.

**Tests:** visual review against `AGENTS.md` §7.11 checklist.

---

# Phase 1 — Public Shell & Access

## T010 — Public layout — P0 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T004, T005.
**Requirements:** header, footer, primary CTA, responsive layout, correct metadata scaffolding.
**Acceptance:** layout holds at 320px–1920px with no horizontal overflow; nav is keyboard operable.

## T011 — Landing page — P0 — `[x]`
**Why:** First contact with the product; drives signup.
**Depends on:** T010. **Spec:** `specs.md` §5.1.
**Requirements:** value proposition, student/mentor/academy benefits, AI-assisted preparation,
practice + feedback explanation, mentorship, progress tracking, CTA.
**Acceptance:** a visitor can state what the product does and how to start within one screen-scroll;
title, description and semantic headings present; no fabricated statistics or testimonials.
**Tests:** metadata smoke test; Lighthouse accessibility pass on the page.

## T012 — Pricing page — P1 — `[ ]`
**Depends on:** T010. **Spec:** `specs.md` §5.2.
**Requirements:** student plan(s), academy/demo CTA, clear plan information, responsive layout. No
billing integration.
**Acceptance:** no control implies a payment capability that does not exist.

## T013 — Authentication — P0 — `[x]`
**Decision resolved 2026-09-18:** Supabase Auth (`status.md` → Decisions, B2).
**Built 2026-09-19:** real signup/login/logout/password-reset via Supabase, after the Student/Mentor/
Academy UIs were reviewed on mock data first (`status.md` §11). Mentor accounts are invite-only
(academy admin → real Supabase invite email, not self-signup), per `specs.md` §8.5.
**Fixed 2026-09-21:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts` only handled the PKCE `code` link format; mentor
invite and password-reset emails are server-initiated and arrive as `token_hash`+`type` instead, so
every such link landed on "link invalid or expired" (bug S49). Now handles both. See `status.md` §13a.
**Why:** Everything role-scoped depends on identity.
**Spec:** `specs.md` §5.3.
**Requirements:** login, signup, logout, session handling, password recovery if applicable,
role-aware redirect, expired-session handling. Secrets stay server-side.
**Acceptance:**
- Valid credentials reach the correct role dashboard.
- Invalid credentials produce a clear, non-enumerating error.
- Logout invalidates the session; back-navigation restores nothing.
- Session expiry redirects with a clear message.
**Tests:** login success, login failure, logout, expired session, redirect-by-role.

## T014 — Role-based access control — P0 — `[x]`
**Built 2026-09-19:** `middleware.ts` + `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` check the session and the
`profiles.role` on every request to `/student`, `/mentor`, `/academy`, `/onboarding` — unauthenticated
requests redirect to `/login`; wrong-role requests redirect to `/forbidden` (verified by direct URL
entry, not just hidden nav). Row Level Security on `profiles`/`academies` enforces the same at the
data layer. **Not yet covered:** the mentee/student/batch data those role areas display is still
mock, in-memory data (see status.md → Technical Debt) — real per-academy data isolation for that
content is separate follow-up work, not part of T014 itself.
**Why:** Role leakage is a P0 security class, not a UX defect.
**Requirements:** route groups per role, server-side authorization on every protected route and data
fetch, unauthorized state, forbidden state, session-expiry handling.
**Acceptance:** a user of one role receives a forbidden/not-found response for another role's route —
verified by direct URL entry, not by hidden navigation. Client-side hiding is never the only control.
**Tests:** unauthorized route access per role; role violation attempt; expired-session access.

---

# Phase 2 — Authenticated Shells

## T020 — Student layout — P0 — `[x]`
## T021 — Mentor layout — P0 — `[x]`
## T022 — Academy layout — P0 — `[x]`

**Depends on:** T004. (Originally also T014; per the 2026-09-18 sequencing decision these are built
now on mock data with **no server-side auth guard yet** — direct URL access to any role's routes is
expected and acceptable until T013/T014 land. This must be recorded as open technical debt in
`status.md` until closed.)
**Requirements (each):** navigation per `specs.md` role navigation (MVP-active items only), header,
profile menu, notifications surface, responsive navigation pattern, breadcrumb/back affordance for
nested capsule navigation.
**Acceptance (each):**
- Only MVP-active destinations appear; deferred features are absent, not stubbed.
- Nested navigation preserves the visual language (`AGENTS.md` §7.6).
- Navigation is fully keyboard operable and works at 320px without a shrunken desktop sidebar.
**Tests:** role navigation renders correct items per role.

---

# Phase 3 — Student MVP (core loop)

## T030 — Student onboarding — P0 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T013, T020. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.2.
**Requirements:** student information, target exam / preparation stage, academy relationship where
applicable, preparation goals, validation, completion state.
**Acceptance:** new student completes onboarding and reaches the dashboard; cannot be silently
skipped or repeated; a refresh mid-flow does not lose entered data.
**Tests:** onboarding completion; validation failure; resume after refresh.

## T031 — Student dashboard — P0 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T030. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.3.
**Requirements:** header, overall readiness, activity metrics, Today's Mission, upcoming session, My
Progress summary, recent activity, recommendations.
**Explicitly excluded:** Achievements, Leaderboard (deferred P2 — see `specs.md` §3).
**Acceptance:**
- Answers "what do I do today / how am I performing / what should I improve".
- Zero-activity student sees a coherent dashboard with a clear first action.
- No hardcoded metric exists anywhere in the component tree.
**Tests:** empty-state dashboard; populated dashboard; no-mock-data assertion.

## T032 — Practice Zone — P0 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T031. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.4.
**Timing resolved 2026-09-18** (`status.md` → Decisions, B4): TAT 30s/picture + 4min writing (12
pictures + 1 blank), WAT 15s/word for 60 words, SRT 30min for 60 situations, SDT 15min/5 prompts.
**Requirements:** practice list, categories as secondary capsules, practice detail, instructions,
question/task, response input, submit flow, loading and error states; Psychology (TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT)
and Interview categories.
**Acceptance:** only real activities are listed; instructions readable before any timed portion;
leaving mid-activity warns rather than silently discarding input.
**Tests:** category navigation; activity open; in-progress navigation guard.

## T033 — Practice submission — P0 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T032. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.5.
**Requirements:** validation, submission state, duplicate prevention, network failure handling,
response preserved during processing.
**Acceptance:**
- One submit action creates exactly one submission; rapid clicks do not duplicate.
- Network failure leaves the response intact and re-submittable.
- Success/failure is never ambiguous to the user.
**Tests:** single submission; double-click idempotency; offline submit; navigate-away during submit.

## T034 — AI feedback — P0 — `[~]` **BLOCKED**
**Blocked by:** AI provider decision and the application-level feedback endpoint.
**Depends on:** T033. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.6.
**Requirements:** feedback request through an application endpoint (never a provider SDK in the
browser), processing state, the five-part structure, AI-assisted indicator, retry.
**Acceptance:** feedback references the actual response; all five sections present or treated as
malformed; indicator visible without interaction; no selection-outcome or diagnostic claim.
**Tests:** successful feedback render; malformed response handling; disclaimer presence.

## T035 — AI failure handling — P0 — `[~]` **BLOCKED by T034**
**Requirements:** timeout, provider error, rate limit, empty response, malformed response, network
error, retry.
**Acceptance:** no failure loses the response; no failure exposes technical detail; retry or a clear
"try later" path always exists; the practice loop remains usable.
**Tests:** one test per failure mode, asserting response preservation and safe messaging.

## T036 — Student progress — P1 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T034. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.8.
**Requirements:** overall readiness, practice performance, skill-area performance, activity history,
improvement areas, trends where data suffices.
**Acceptance:** no percentage without explainable derivation; insufficient data is stated, not faked.
**Tests:** insufficient-data state; populated state.

## T037 — Student resources — P1 — `[x]`
**Requirements:** list, categories, detail, read/completion state where required.
**Acceptance:** empty state exists; completion state persists.

## T037a — Day 2 Resources (TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT/Full Day 2 external library) — P1 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T037. **Spec:** curated externally-sourced practice library for Day 2 psychology
testing, not part of the original `specs.md` §6 wording — logged here retroactively (AGENTS.md §20)
since the feature was built as an untracked side change before this entry existed.
**Requirements (round 3, 2026-09-23):** round 2's IA held up under user review, but the UI was still too
text-heavy and visually flat. Cut redundant copy across every level (hero dropped its description line
and resource count; category hero dropped its explanation paragraph and count — that copy now lives
once, on the test card's flip-back; section-picker/test-grid headings dropped their repeat-the-heading
subtitles; the Full Day 2 banner dropped a sentence the chain visual right below it already said; the
overview page's closing "Start with TAT" line was removed as pure redundancy with the hero's own Quick
Start button). Replaced the second-level taxonomy: Learn Basics/**Examples**/Practice/Videos/Feedback →
Learn Basics/Practice/**Tests**/Videos/**Articles**/Feedback (`lib/day2/sections.ts`, rewritten) —
verified against the real dataset that dropping "Examples" orphans nothing (every `example`-tagged
resource also carries `learn` or a practice/test purpose). Replaced all five `Day2Visual` category marks
with fuller illustrated scenes (same line-art language) instead of sparse sketches, added a subtle
gradient wash to card visual bands, and slowed/smoothed the flip and entrance animations
(`--motion-duration-flip` 480ms→650ms with a new calmer `--motion-easing-premium` curve,
`--motion-duration-entrance` 420ms→520ms, longer stagger) — all still `prefers-reduced-motion`-safe via
the existing global rule. No change to the underlying dataset or to Supabase auth.
**Requirements (round 2, 2026-09-22):** round 1 (below) still dumped a whole category's resources on
one page; the user rejected it after visual inspection as "a database/resource dump" and asked for a
true three-level progressive-disclosure IA instead:
`/student/resources/day-2` (orientation only — short hero with an illustration + Quick Start CTA, a
TAT→WAT→SRT→SD/SDT→Full Day 2 journey strip, a slim "Recommended for beginners" row, a 5-card flip-card
test grid, an optional Recently Viewed strip) →
`/student/resources/day-2/[tat|wat|srt|sd-sdt|full-day]` (category hero, then "What do you want to
do?" — only the sections with a real matching resource: Learn Basics/Examples/Practice/Videos/Feedback,
`lib/day2/sections.ts`; Full Day 2 additionally gets its own chain banner + "Start Full Day 2" CTA) →
`/student/resources/day-2/[category]?do=<section>` (only then do resources actually render, scoped to
that one section, with its own search). Five test cards and every section card use one shared flip-card
component (`day2-flip-card.tsx`) — front: visual + title + count + Explore; back (hover on desktop,
or an independent keyboard/tap info-toggle button): one-sentence "what is this". Five restrained
per-category accent colours were added as a deliberate, scoped exception to `AGENTS.md` §7.1 (Decisions
Register, status.md). Resource cards dropped verification-status and pricing/access badges from the
card face entirely — that research metadata still lives in the data, it's just not printed. Every
resource still links out to its real source; AI-feedback tools still carry their accuracy disclosure.
No change to the underlying curated dataset (`lib/mock/day2-resources.ts`) — only which of its fields
the UI prints.
**Requirements (round 1):** a hub-and-spoke IA, not a single-page dump of all 57 resources:
`/student/resources/day-2` is orientation only — hero, a TAT→WAT→SRT→SD/SDT→Full Day 2 journey strip,
a "New to Day 2?" guided flow, and a 5-card category grid with real, data-driven resource counts — and
shows no individual resource. Each test has its own page at
`/student/resources/day-2/[tat|wat|srt|sd-sdt|full-day]` (`lib/day2/categories.ts` holds the slug↔
category mapping) showing only that test's resources: a breadcrumb + back link, a category hero, that
category's featured resource as "Recommended starting point", the rest grouped into Study
Guides/Examples/Practice/Videos/Feedback (`lib/mock/day2-resources.ts`, sourced from
`docs/day2-final-curated-resources.md`) with only non-empty groups rendered — SD/SDT stays honestly
thin rather than padded — plus a category-scoped search + group filter. Every resource links out to
its real source (no scraped/reproduced content); AI-feedback tools carry an unverified-claims
disclaimer.
**Acceptance:** no invented resources, URLs, ratings, reviews, statistics or resource counts; an
invalid category slug 404s; empty states exist at all three levels; accessible (keyboard, focus states,
status never colour-only; flip cards keyboard/tap-operable independent of hover); responsive with no
horizontal overflow (verified at 1440/768/390px); animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; reachable
only through the normal authenticated student flow (no route-specific auth bypass, dev or otherwise) —
verified in round 2 with a real signed-up browser session (not just an anonymous-redirect check).
**Tests:** `tests/unit/components/day2-section-picker.test.tsx` (non-empty-only sections, thin-category
case, links carry a `?do=` query) and `tests/unit/components/day2-resource-list.test.tsx` (section-scoped
results, back link, search + empty state, no verification/pricing text on a card, real-URL/new-tab link
safety) — both run against the real curated dataset via `getDay2ResourcesByCategory`. Round 1's
`day2-category-explorer.test.tsx` was deleted along with the component it tested (split into the two
files above).

## T038 — Student profile — P1 — `[x]`
**Requirements:** profile info, edit, validation, account settings.
**Acceptance:** edits persist; a failed save does not lose input.

## T039 — 5-Day SSB Practice Journey — P1 — `[x]`
**Why:** Un-deferred 2026-09-20 by explicit user direction, referencing Target SSB (targetssb.in) as
functional/structural inspiration. **Spec:** `specs.md` §6.4a (also see §3 Scope Decisions and §13).
**Depends on:** T032 (Practice Zone), T037 (reuses the resources reading/detail pattern).
**Requirements:** `/student/practice` becomes a 5-day overview (progress ring + Day 1–5 list); each
day lists its modules (`app/student/practice/[day]/page.tsx`); each module resolves via
`app/student/practice/[day]/[module]/page.tsx` to reading/info content, a self-paced practice bank
(MCQ or free-text), a timed test (new MCQ runner for OIR/OIR Non-verbal; PPDT reuses the existing
carousel runner), the Final Self Assessment checklist, or the Day 5 summary. Day 2's Test cards and
Day 4's Personal Interview card link to the *existing* Psychology/Interview routes (T032/T033)
instead of duplicating that flow — a direct hit on a module URL with an `href` redirects to the real
page rather than rendering empty content.
**Acceptance:**
- Every module in `specs.md` §6.4a resolves to a working page; no dead links.
- Progress counts/percentages are always computed from real content-array lengths, never invented.
- Existing Psychology/Interview behavior (T032/T033) is unchanged.
- No hydration mismatch: components reading localStorage-derived progress start at the SSR-safe
  default and update post-mount, not via a value computed directly (or via a lazy initializer) during
  render — verified by a full signed-up walkthrough with zero client console/page errors.
**Tests:** manual full-journey walkthrough (signup → every day → a practice bank → a timed test →
self-assessment → final summary) in a production build, zero console/page errors; `npm run build` /
`npx tsc --noEmit` / `npx eslint .` all clean.
**Technical debt carried forward (see `status.md` → Technical Debt):** all bank content is small
placeholder data (real counts, not the reference product's production-scale banks); no backend
persistence (same mock/localStorage pattern as the rest of Student, T014's known gap); no mentor/
academy visibility into journey progress; AI feedback on journey submissions is blocked on B3, same
as T034.

## T039b — Interview & Conference practice depth — P1 — `[-]`
**Why:** User request 2026-09-24: improve Day 4's Personal Interview and Day 5's Conference.
**Spec:** `specs.md` §6.4b. **Depends on:** T039.
**Requirements:** saved answers in every free-text practice bank · per-question guidance and a
self-review checklist for interview/conference questions · PIQ form → template-generated interview
questions · timed mock interview and mock conference with a review screen.
**Acceptance:** as listed in `specs.md` §6.4b.
**Tests:** unit (answer store, PIQ generator, mock question selection) · integration (runner restores
and keeps answers, guidance and self-review, PIQ form validation, mock run to review) · e2e not
possible for these logged-in routes until seeded test accounts exist (see T066).

---

# Phase 4 — Mentor MVP

## T040 — Mentor dashboard — P0 — `[x]`
**Depends on:** T021, T014. **Spec:** `specs.md` §7.2.
**Acceptance:** the mentor can identify a concrete next action within one screen; a mentor with no
mentees sees a coherent empty state; all metrics real.

## T041 — Mentee list — P0 — `[x]`
**Requirements:** list, search where necessary, useful filters, performance, weak areas, evaluation
status, last activity.
**Acceptance:** authorisation is enforced server-side, not by client filtering.
**Tests:** mentor sees only assigned mentees.

## T042 — Mentee detail — P0 — `[x]`
**Requirements:** overview, batch, performance, activity, AI feedback, mentor feedback, evaluation
action, session action where applicable.
**Acceptance:** URL tampering to a non-assigned student returns forbidden/not-found with no partial
data leak.
**Tests:** IDOR attempt on mentee detail.

## T043 — Mentor evaluation — P0 — `[x]`
**Spec:** `specs.md` §7.5.
**Acceptance:** draft recoverable; submission idempotent; evaluation appears on the student record
with evaluator and timestamp; only approved criteria used.
**Tests:** draft save/restore; double submit; student-side visibility.

## T044 — Mentor sessions (basic) — P1 — `[x]`
**Requirements:** list, detail, create basic session, scheduled/completed/cancelled, join/view where
applicable. No complex scheduling infrastructure.
**Acceptance:** a created session appears on both mentor and student views; cancellation reflects in
both.

## T045 — Mentor profile — P1 — `[x]`

---

# Phase 5 — Academy Admin MVP

## T050 — Academy dashboard — P0 — `[x]`
**Spec:** `specs.md` §8.2.
**Acceptance:** every figure scoped to the admin's academy server-side; each chart has a stated
interpretation; attention signals state their reason and never judge character.

## T051 — Student management — P0 — `[x]`
**Acceptance:** duplicate validation on add; auditable status changes; no cross-academy assignment.
**Tests:** cross-academy assignment rejected.

## T052 — Batch management — P0 — `[x]`
**Acceptance:** removing a student from a batch preserves their history.

## T053 — Mentor management — P1 — `[x]`
**Acceptance:** invited-but-not-accepted mentors are visibly distinct from active mentors.

## T054 — Academy reports — P1 — `[x]`
**Acceptance:** insufficient data is stated plainly rather than rendered as an empty or misleading
chart.

## T055 — Academy profile & settings — P1 — `[x]`

---

# Phase 6 — Cross-Cutting Quality

## T060 — Authorization audit — P0 — `[ ]`
**Covers:** role permissions, resource ownership, academy isolation, direct URL access, manipulated
IDs, expired sessions.
**Acceptance:** every finding is either fixed or filed as a P0 bug in `status.md`. No client-only
control remains on a sensitive path.
**Tests:** the full security set in `AGENTS.md` §17.

## T061 — State audit — P0 — `[ ]`
For every major feature: loading, empty, error, success, retry/recovery.
**Acceptance:** no feature reaches production with an undefined state; no raw technical error surfaces.

## T062 — Responsive audit — P0 — `[ ]`
Desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile; navigation, capsules, tables, charts, forms, dialogs.
**Acceptance:** no horizontal overflow at 320px; capsules adapt rather than shrink.

## T063 — Accessibility audit — P0 — `[ ]`
Keyboard, focus, labels, semantic headings, button names, contrast (with glass applied), screen-reader
structure, non-colour status, touch targets, reduced motion.
**Acceptance:** no critical action or status depends on colour alone; all interactive capsules are
keyboard reachable with visible focus.

## T064 — Performance audit — P1 — `[ ]`
Initial load, dashboard requests, duplicate requests, large lists, charts, images, client JS, and
blur cost (no stacked or animated `backdrop-filter`).
**Acceptance:** measured numbers recorded in `status.md`; no invented targets.

## T065 — Security audit — P0 — `[ ]`
No committed secrets, environment variables checked, server-side authorization, input validation,
cross-academy isolation, sensitive API responses, safe error messages, rate limiting where required.

## T066 — Critical testing — P0 — `[-]`
Authentication, role access, onboarding, practice submission, AI feedback, AI failure, mentor
evaluation, academy access, academy isolation, form validation.
**Acceptance:** the suite runs in CI and fails the build on regression.
**Progress (2026-09-20):** Test runners installed (Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/component,
Playwright for e2e) — `npm test` / `npm run test:e2e`. 32 Vitest cases + 9 Playwright cases passing,
covering auth validation, the route→role authorization mapping, login-form behavior (including
AGENTS.md §11's "never lose the student's input" rule), and unauthenticated route-guard redirects.
Full manual + automated test-case index: `tests/TEST_CASES.md`. **Still open:** CI wiring (no
pipeline exists yet to make this "fail the build on regression"); academy-isolation cases are
written as `.todo`/`GAP` because the behavior they'd test doesn't exist until T060's backend
migration; AI feedback cases (`STU-05`, `STU-06`) blocked on B3; several P0/P1 cases across mentor/
academy workflows remain manual-only (see `tests/TEST_CASES.md` §§2–5 status column).
**Progress (2026-09-24):** Suite split into three explicit layers — `tests/unit`, new
`tests/integration`, `tests/e2e` — each runnable on its own (`test:unit` / `test:integration` /
`test:e2e`). 84 Vitest (52 unit/component + 32 integration) + 9 Playwright cases passing. New
integration coverage includes the logged-in role guard (wrong role / missing profile → `/forbidden`),
which e2e can't reach without seeded accounts. CI added (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Local e2e
timeouts fixed (one worker against the dev server). **Still open:** CI hasn't run on GitHub yet —
needs the branch pushed and the two Supabase repo secrets set for the e2e job; "fail the build on
regression" also needs a branch-protection rule requiring the CI checks on `main`.

# Phase 7 — MVP Polish

## T073 — Academy shell + dashboard redesign — P1 — `[x]`
**Why:** User request 2026-09-24: Academy admin needs a premium, reusable shell and an actionable dashboard (reference design supplied).
**Requirements:** reusable navy sidebar with separate reusable footer · config-driven navigation · header · responsive (rail/drawer) · dashboard built from shared components on the existing data contract · no fabricated data.
**Acceptance:** dashboard renders from `getDashboardData`/`getStudents`/`getMentors`; empty state works; no horizontal overflow at 390/820/1440px; lint, typecheck, tests, build pass.
**Update 2026-10-03:** trend chart, assessment radar and upcoming sessions added on demo-flagged data (`getAnalytics()`); real data needs new assessment-score, skill-rubric and sessions tables. KPI month-over-month deltas still deferred (no history).
**Tests:** unit — `tests/unit/lib/academy-dashboard-view.test.ts`.

---

## T074 — Academy Students management page — P1 — `[x]`
**Why:** User request 2026-10-04: production-quality student list for the Academy Admin.
**Acceptance:** search + filters + sort work together via URL params; pagination; add student via dialog with validation/loading/success/error; row actions limited to supported operations; empty, no-results and error states; responsive (table → cards); lint/typecheck/tests pass.
**Open (needs data model):** real Supabase `students` table, email, created date, edit student, per-student mentor assignment.
**Tests:** unit — `tests/unit/lib/academy-student-list.test.ts`.

---

## T075 — Academy Batches management (Supabase) — P1 — `[-]`
**Why:** User request 2026-10-04: a real, end-to-end Batches MVP for the Academy Admin.
**Acceptance:** list/search/filter/sort/paginate from Postgres; create + edit (name, mentor, start date); assign/change mentor; archive/restore; summary counts from the database; loading/empty/no-results/error states; admin-only writes enforced server-side and by RLS; no service-role key; lint/typecheck/tests pass.
**Status:** code + unit tests done; blocked only on applying `0003_batches.sql` and live verification by a signed-in admin.
**Deferred:** per-batch student counts (needs `students.batch_id`), batch detail page, delete.
**Tests:** unit — `academy-batch-logic.test.ts`, `batches-supabase.test.ts`.

---

## T070 — Design system consistency pass — P1 — `[ ]`
**Updated 2026-09-19:** the design system itself changed (Glass Capsule → Apple-Inspired Glass UI v3,
`AGENTS.md` §7, see `status.md` → Decisions). The core migration (tokens, shell, primary dashboards)
is done; this task now means finishing the sweep on secondary pages (batches, students, mentors,
reports, settings, evaluations, sessions, resources, progress) onto `StatCard`/`ListPanel`/`PageHeader`
throughout, plus dropdown/`<Select>` glass-thick styling — see `status.md` → Technical Debt.
**Requirements:** verify every screen against `AGENTS.md` §7.13; confirm glass tier usage, accent
usage, icon family, spacing, typography, token usage.
**Acceptance:** zero raw colour/radius/blur/duration literals in components; every acceptance-test
item in §7.13 answers "yes" on every screen.

## T071 — Dashboard review — P1 — `[ ]`
Student: clear daily action, progress, improvement area.
Mentor: students needing attention, pending evaluations, schedule.
Academy: readiness, batch performance, students needing attention.

## T072 — Production readiness — P0 — `[ ]`
Production environment variables, build succeeds, lint succeeds, tests pass, security reviewed,
responsive reviewed, no debug logs, no mock data in production paths, public metadata reviewed.

# Phase 8 — Content Administration

One branch per panel: `feat/admin-student-content` (T081), `feat/admin-mentor-content` (T082),
`feat/admin-academy-content` (T083). Each is rebased onto T080 after it merges. Each change ships as
its own PR into `main`.

## T080 — Admin access foundation — P1 — `[-]`
**Why:** User request 2026-10-07: separate admin panels for adding student, mentor and academy
material, with access given only to the people who need it.
**Spec:** `specs.md` §8a.1–§8a.2.
**Requirements:** `admin_grants` table and RLS (`supabase/migrations/0004_admin_access.sql`).
Super-admin-only SQL functions for the email lookup and the grant list, so no service-role key is
used. A `/admin` middleware guard that is independent of `profiles.role`. Every `/admin` page and
action re-checks on the server. `/admin` overview, `/admin/access` (grant/remove), and a guarded
placeholder page for each area.
**Acceptance:** as listed in `specs.md` §8a.2 (T080 block). Lint, typecheck, unit and integration
tests, and the build all pass.
**Status:** code and tests done. Waiting on applying `0004_admin_access.sql`, bootstrapping the first
super admin (SQL in the migration header), and live verification by a signed-in super admin and an
area editor.
**Tests:** unit — `admin-access.test.ts` (route → requirement map, `canAccess`, input parsing),
`admin-access-actions.test.ts` (grant/revoke authorization, validation, anti-lockout); integration —
`middleware-session.test.ts` (`/admin` cases).

## T081 — Student content panel — P1 — `[ ]`
**Depends on:** T080. **Spec:** `specs.md` §8a (acceptance to be written before building).
**Scope:** practice banks (TAT/WAT/SRT/SDT items), 5-Day Journey modules and banks, resources,
Day 2 resources. Postgres tables and RLS keyed on `has_admin_area('student_content')` replace the
matching `lib/mock/*` modules. Student-facing pages read the same `lib/api/*` contract, so student
UI is unchanged.

## T082 — Mentor content panel — P1 — `[!]`
**Depends on:** T080. **Needs decision:** evaluation rubrics, session templates and mentor guidance
are not specced anywhere yet (`specs.md` §7.5 only allows evaluation criteria "approved in this
specification"). Write their spec in `specs.md` first.

## T083 — Academy content panel — P1 — `[ ]`
**Depends on:** T080. **Spec:** `specs.md` §8a.
**Scope:** students, batches, mentors and settings at platform level. It must respect academy
isolation (`AGENTS.md` §10), so every record stays scoped to one academy. Batches already live in
Postgres (T075); students do not yet (T074's open item).

# Task Execution Procedure

1. Read the task and its acceptance criteria.
2. Read the relevant `specs.md` section.
3. Inspect existing code and identify consumers (`AGENTS.md` §4).
4. Implement the smallest correct version.
5. Implement loading, empty, error and success states.
6. Verify authorization server-side.
7. Verify behaviour against the acceptance criteria — actually exercise it.
8. Run lint, type-check, tests and build.
9. Update `task.md` status and `status.md`.
10. Commit with a meaningful message.

## Definition of task completion

Implementation works · expected behaviour verified · relevant errors handled · authorization correct ·
responsive behaviour acceptable · relevant tests exist or their absence is justified · lint and build
pass · no unrelated changes · documentation updated.

## Final priority

If building more features conflicts with making the core workflow reliable:

> **Choose reliability of the core workflow.**

**Student Practice → AI Feedback → Improvement**, supported by
**Mentor Guidance + Academy Visibility**.
